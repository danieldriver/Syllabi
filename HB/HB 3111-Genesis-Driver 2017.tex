\cdescription{% copy from the current Academic Calendar
	In the modern period an enormous amount has been written about the
	genesis of Genesis, the history \emph{behind} the first book of the
	Bible. Prior to the critical era, however, perhaps even more has
	been written in commentary upon the Book of Genesis, forming a
	history \emph{before} the text (the history of the book's
	reception). These two approaches to the history of Genesis can seem
	radically different. Indeed, some commentators today still hold that
	the dawn of the historical-critical era marks a definitive break
	with traditional interpretation, for good or for ill. Then again,
	others now seek to combine what can be known about worlds behind and
	before the Book of Genesis into a more comprehensive theological
	vision. In this course we will explore histories of Genesis in
	parallax, seeking above all to let them shape our understanding of
	the Book of Genesis as a core part of Jewish and Christian scripture
	from antiquity down through the present day.

An acceptable alternative study Bible is the NJPS: Adele Berlin and Marc
Zvi Brettler, eds., \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition}
(Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). A reference copy is
available in the library, and it is well worth consulting.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings will be recommended throughout the semester.
Excerpts from this literature may either be placed on reserve or made
available for download through the course website. Outstanding students
will also pursue leads on their own, making maximum use of notes and
bibliographies in the required textbooks.

\section{Evaluation and Grade Structure}
\label{evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item The professor will set \textbf{reading prompts} throughout the
	semester, as often as once a week. Prompts will consist of questions
	drawn from the secondary reading, and so presuppose that students
	have read the assigned material carefully. Points may be deducted if
	it becomes evident that the reading has not been taken seriously.

	\item Every other week, students will lead \textbf{seminars} on
	single chapters from the Book of Genesis. They should take the lead
	by briefly outlining the chapter in question, situating it relative
	to the rest of Genesis, and reporting on their research into part of
	that chapter. Then, in the balance of the time, they should helping
	the class elaborate, reflect on, test, challenge, or extend a
	central idea or two. Students are encouraged to align their seminar
	preparations with their choice of texts for their exegetical paper.

	\item A major \textbf{exegetical paper} will facilitate an extended
	exercise in biblical interpretation. It should focus on a short
	passage from Genesis, should interact with the secondary readings
	and further research into the passage in question, and should be
	3--4,000 words long. It is due at the start of the last class.

%	\begin{enumerate}
%
%		\item The \textbf{first paper} will focus on a passage from
%		Genesis 1--11 and should interact carefully with
%		\cite{anderson}, among others.
%
%		\item The \textbf{second paper} will focus on a passage from
%		Genesis 12--50 and should interact carefully with
%		\cite{levenson}, among others.
