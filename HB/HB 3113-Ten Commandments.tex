	As the first words spoken by God at Sinai and the leading terms of a

%	From 2018 (truncated for Academic Calendar 2021--2022):
%
%	As the first words spoken by God at Sinai and the leading terms of a
%	covenant sealed with blood, the Ten Commandments are well known as
%	the preeminent instance of biblical law. Less well appreciated is
%	the complex legal and cultic context that gave rise to multiple
%	versions of the Decalogue in ancient Israel, as seen in Exodus 20,
%	Deuteronomy 5, Exodus 34, and Leviticus 19.
%
%	This course examines the ancient origins of the Ten Commandments as
%	a premier example of the Bible’s legal traditions. It also considers
%	the weight that these laws have held for Jews, Christians, and
%	others through an exploration of the Decalogue’s reception history,
%	which includes modes of expression as diverse as liturgy, biblical
%	commentary, fine art, film, and popular culture. Finally, with ample
%	time to consider a commandment per week, the course invites students
%	to reflect creatively on the ethical trajectory of the commandments,
%	their place in contemporary religious life, and their stature in and
%	beyond the Christian Church.

\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
By the end of the course students should be able to:
	recite the Ten Commandments in a received order, and summarize the way different religious traditions count to Ten;
	locate and contextualize at least three versions of the Ten Commandments in the Bible;
	interpret each of the Commandments in their immediate literary contexts;
	integrate an understanding of the Ten Commandments with a broader view of biblical law;
	understand, in broad terms, how the Commandments have been interpreted in history;
	independently investigate the historic use of some Commandments;
	identify, evaluate, and report on contemporary connections with at least one of the Ten Commandments.

the needs of the class.

numbers, except in the case of Rossetti, which gives page numbers.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\input{\policy/tutorials}

%	Assignments as set in 2018:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%	\item I will set \textbf{discussion prompts} for each of the Ten
%	Commandments. They are intended to help you engage with the assigned
%	reading material, and with your classmates. Prompt responses should
%	be about 250 words long. Questions will go up by the start of each
%	class (10 \AM\ Atlantic Time). Answer the week's question by the end
%	of Tuesday. Then, by the end of Wednesday, read through the
%	responses of your classmates, and post another 50 words or so as you
%	interact with them.
%
%	\item Students are to make a \textbf{creative presentation} on one
%	of the Ten Commandments in the week in which that Commandment is
%	under investigation. Week 3 is an exception, since it is reserved
%	for the Prologue and Commandments I and II. Presentations may take
%	the form of a podcast or video, and their contents may be anything
%	that merits the adjective “creative” -- an interview, a dramatic
%	piece, some form of engagement with culture, or anything else
%	suitable that you envision. Each one should last 15 to 20 minutes,
%	and should feel like it deserves 20\% of the final grade. The only
%	strict requirement is that the work be sharable by URL. (Try
%	SoundCloud or YouTube.)
%
%	\item A \textbf{review essay} on Coogan's \emph{The Ten
%	Commandments} will be due at the end of the sixth week of class
%	(Friday, 16 February 2018). It should be 2,250 words long, plus or
%	minus 10\%. The first third of the essay should be a summary of the
%	work, while the remaining two thirds should be devoted to critical
%	engagement and evaluation.
%
%	\item A comprehensive \textbf{final paper} will give students an
%	opportunity to explore one of the Ten Commandments in detail,
%	complete with a thesis that involves original exposition and
%	theological reflection. It is due the Friday before the last class
%	(6 April 2018). It should be 3,500 words long, plus or minus 10\%
%	(the total count includes footnotes but not the final bibliography).
