\cdescription[HB 2201]{% copy from the current Academic Calendar; [] for prereqs
	The natural continuation of HB 2201, this course is for those who
	wish to have a complete introduction to the basics of biblical
	Hebrew. Students will progress through encounters with less regular
	paradigms and more complicated syntax, building confidence as they
	master select readings from Genesis. The goal of the full course
	series, in two parts, is a proficiency in the rudiments of Hebrew
	that is sufficient for the independent reading of biblical books.

\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
	The basic goal of this course is to become proficient in the
	rudiments of biblical Hebrew, sufficient for the independent reading
	of biblical books in this language. It is part of a series designed
	for two semesters of study. In the first semester students will
	learn everything from the alphabet to the basics of Hebrew nouns and
	verbs. In the second semester the emphasis will fall on less regular
	paradigms and more complicated syntax. The steady acquisition of
	vocabulary will be emphasized across both semesters.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

The following texts are required. Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase their own copies. Digital copies are available within
\href{https://www.logos.com/product/177582/learning-biblical-hebrew-bundle}{Logos}.
A hard copy of the workbook at least is preferable, since it is filled
with worksheets on which you will want to write.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

The following works are worth owning and consulting, especially
\cite{bhs} and \cite{bdb}. \cite{rlgs} contains sound advice on core
skills like reading religious texts, writing essays and reviews,
revising essays, making presentations, and learning languages.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

The grade structure for \ccode has the following elements.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item
    Students are expected to read and study all \textbf{lessons} in
    Chapters 11–23 of the \cite{lbh}, and to complete the accompanying
    \textbf{exercises} and Hebrew \textbf{readings} in the \cite{work}.
    Students should use the answer key to correct and evaluate their own
    work. Assignments will be assessed at the end of each week for
    completeness only. Students who are taking the course for credit
    should be prepared to show evidence of their efforts and, if
    requested, to upload scans (PDFs) or photos of any relevant pages
    from the \cite{work} to the course website.
 \item
    \textbf{Quizzes} are based on the \cite{lbh} and \cite{work}
    assignments. Between six and ten quizzes will be set throughout the
    twelve-week course. All quizzes are closed book. Students must take
    opportunities accurately to assess what they have learned and
    retained. Continuing education students and auditors are encouraged
    to participate in these exercises fully by scoring and correcting
    their own work.

%%%%%%% For online delivery
% \item
%    Students who are taking the course for credit must use a
%    \textbf{proctor} to administer and attest their quizzes. Select
%    someone over the age of 18 to act as your proctor. Instruct them to
%    email your instructor
%    (\href{mailto:ddriver@astheology.ns.ca}{ddriver@astheology.ns.ca})
%    to receive electronic copies of all six quizzes for this course.
%    When you are ready to take each quiz, your proctor will provide you
%    with a printed copy of the test materials. Be sure that you include
%    compensation for them to do so, as appropriate. When you are
%    finished with each quiz, the proctor will verify that it was taken
%    as prescribed, attest it by signing their name under your name, and
%    make sure that you submit it online. Please upload each quiz to the
%    correct assignment slot on Teams. You will obviously need to scan
%    each one as a PDF (preferred) or take a photo of each page with your
%    cell phone.
