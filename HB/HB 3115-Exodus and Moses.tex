Who is Moses, and what does his life have to do with Israel’s exodus
from Egypt? This course will examine the Moses story in the context of
the Book of Exodus, attending above all to the book’s canonical shape
and its historic reception. Students will also become familiar with some
of the current debate about the formation of the Pentateuch,
particularly as it relates to different accounts of Israel’s origins in
the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

% A Model of Learning Objectives
% Adapted from http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
%
% A learning objective should contain a *subject* (a verb related to
% cognitive process) and an *object* (a noun identifying the knowledge
% or skill sought). Statements should be precise and measurable, e.g.,
% "By the end of this course, students will be able to <verb> <noun>."
%
% Anderson and Krathwohl name four *classes of knowledge* that students
% can be expected to acquire. Terms move from the concrete to the
% abstract:
%
%   1. factual           (basic elements, details, terminology)
%   2. conceptual        (interrelationship of basic elements)
%   3. procedural        (skills, methods, techniques, criteria)
%   4. metacognitive     (strategy, context and conditions, self-knowledge)
%
% Metacognitive knowledge is a special case. It concerns one's own
% "cognition and about oneself in relation to various subject matters"
% (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, p.44).
%
% A&K also identify 19 *cognitive processes*, arranged in six categories
% (a 2001 revision of Bloom's 1957 taxonomy) that progress from lower
% order to higher order thinking skills (from LOTS to HOTS):
%
%   1. remember
%      * recognizing     (identifying)
%      * recalling       (retrieving)
%   2. understand
%      * interpreting    (clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating)
%      * exemplifying    (illustrating, instantiating)
%      * classifying     (categorizing, subsuming)
%      * summarizing     (abstracting, generalizing)
%      * inferring       (concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting)
%      * comparing       (contrasting, mapping, matching)
%      * explaining      (constructing models)
%   3. apply
%      * executing       (carrying out)
%      * implementing    (using)
%   4. analyze
%      * differentiating (discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting)
%      * organizing      (finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring)
%      * attributing     (deconstructing)
%   5. evaluate
%      * checking        (coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing)
%      * critiquing      (judging)
%   6. create
%      * generating      (hypothesizing)
%      * planning        (designing)
%      * producing       (constructing)
%
% If you reference a List of Measurable Verbs Used to Assess Learning
% Outcomes, remember that A&K reverse Bloom's 6th and 5th categories.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

The following texts are required. Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase their own copies. Library copies that are not reference works
have been placed on a 2-hour reserve.

An acceptable alternative study Bible is the NJPS: Adele Berlin and Marc
Zvi Brettler, eds., \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition}
(Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). A reference copy is
available in the library, and it is well worth consulting.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings will be recommended throughout the semester.
Excerpts from this literature, ordinarily an article or a book chapter
per week, will either be placed on reserve or made available for
download through the course website.

Students are not strictly required to read this additional material;
then again, students who choose not to read it should not expect to
receive an ``A'' for the course. Stated more positively, these
selections represent some of the best contemporary readers of the HB/OT,
and you will not want to miss out on their hermeneutical and theological
insights.

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

We will adhere to the schedule in \autoref{schedule} as closely as
possible, though the professor reserves the right to adjust it to suit
the needs of the class.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item I will set \textbf{reading prompts} throughout the semester.
	They are designed to ensure that you have read the assigned material
	carefully, and to help you explore its significance. Prompt
	responses submitted online should be between 250 and 300 words long.

%	\item Students are to \textbf{memorize ten verses from the Psalms}
%	in the King James Version and recite them to me privately by the
%	last day of class. You may select ten verses from one psalm, one
%	verse from ten psalms, or any combination in between.

	\item Two \textbf{short papers} will facilitate student reflection
	on two extended works of biblical interpretation, one by
	\cite{heschel} and one by \cite{irenaeus}. Each should be 3,000
	words long. They are due on the sixth and eleventh days of class,
	respectively.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item The \textbf{first paper} will articulate and evaluate
		multiple rationales for sabbath observance by interacting with
		biblical and post-biblical traditions. The latter must include,
		but need not be limited to, Heschel's \emph{The Sabbath}.

		\item The \textbf{second paper} will explore Irenaeus' use of
		the Old Testament as Christian scripture by: succinctly
		summarizing \emph{On the Apostolic Preaching}, selecting a
		characteristic example of biblical interpretation in that work,
		and then developing and defending a coherent thesis about that
		instance of interpretation.

	\end{enumerate}
