\cdescription[HB 2201. This DSt is the equivalent of HB 2202]{% copy from the current Academic Calendar
	A more detailed study of Hebrew grammar and syntax through the
	reading of selected biblical texts, this course is designed as a
	continuation of HB 2201. For a complete introduction, students will
	continue through two semesters of study. In the second semester
	emphasis will fall on verbs, especially the less regular paradigms,
	and on more complicated syntax. (This course is open to
	undergraduate students from other universities. Please contact the
	Registrar to enroll as a Letter of Permission student.)

\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy
	The basic goal of this course is for students to become proficient
	in the rudiments of biblical Hebrew, sufficient for the independent
	reading of biblical books in this language. In this Directed Study,
	students will be given support as they continue to develop their
	ability to learn Hebrew independently. Building on their initial
	study in HB 2201, students in this course will read and translate a
	passages from Genesis (the Joseph Story) as they advance in their
	ability to read the Hebrew Bible with confidence and understanding.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

The following texts are required. Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase their own copies. Digital copies are available within
\href{https://www.logos.com/product/177582/learning-biblical-hebrew-bundle}{Logos}.
A hard copy of the workbook at least is preferable, since it is filled
with worksheets on which you will want to write.

The following reference works are worth owning and consulting.
\cite{rlgs} in particular contains sound advice on core skills like
reading religious texts, writing essays and reviews, revising essays,
making oral presentations, and learning languages.

\section{Evaluation and Grade Structure}
\label{evaluation}

The grade structure for \ccode has the following elements.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item
    Students are expected to read and study all \textbf{lessons} in
    Chapters 11–19 of the \cite{lbh}, and to complete the accompanying
    \textbf{exercises} in the \cite{work}, as outlined in the schedule
    in \autoref{schedule}. Students should use the answer key to correct
    and evaluate their own work. Assignments will be periodically
    collected and assessed, largely on the basis of completeness.
 \item
    \textbf{Quizzes} are based on the \cite{lbh} and \cite{work}
    assignments. Some number will be set across the semester, depending
    on the need. Quizzes are closed book. Students must take
    opportunities to assess what they have learned and retained.
 \item
    If it is not possible for distance students to administer their own
    quizzes, then they should use a \textbf{proctor} to administer and
    attest their quizzes. Select someone over the age of 18 to act as
    your proctor. Instruct them to email your instructor
    (\href{mailto:ddriver@astheology.ns.ca}{ddriver@astheology.ns.ca})
    to receive electronic copies of the quizzes for this course. When
    you are ready to take each quiz, your proctor will provide you with
    a printed copy of the test materials. Be sure that you include
    compensation for them to do so, as appropriate. When you are
    finished with each quiz, the proctor will verify that it was taken
    as prescribed, attest it by signing their name under your name, and
    make sure that you submit it online. Please upload each quiz to the
    correct assignment slot on Teams. You will need to scan each one as
    a PDF (strongly preferred) or take a photo of each page with your
    cell phone (if all else fails).
 \item
    A \textbf{final creative project} will dramatize the workbook
    reading in Chapter 19 (a version of Genesis 48), which will be the
    major focus of tutorial sessions in the last third of the course.
\end{enumerate}

The breakdown for the semester's total work is shown in
\autoref{distribution}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

  \begin{tabular}{lr}
    \toprule
    Workbook      & 40\% \\
