\cdescription[HB 2201]{% copy from the current Academic Calendar; [] for prereqs
	A more detailed study of Hebrew grammar and syntax through the
	reading of selected biblical texts, this course is designed as a
	continuation of HB 2201. For a complete introduction, students will
	continue through two semesters of study. In the second semester
	emphasis will fall on less regular paradigms (learned inductively)
	and more complicated syntax. The basic goal of the entire course is
	for students to become pro cient in the rudiments of biblical
	Hebrew, su cient for the independent reading of biblical books.
	(This course is open to undergraduate students from other
	universities. Please contact the AST Registrar to enroll as a Letter
	of Permission student.)

\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
	The basic goal of this course is to become proficient in the
	rudiments of biblical Hebrew. The introductory course is designed
	for two semesters of study, and it is presumed that students will
	take the course for the entire academic year. In the first semester
	students will learn everything from the alphabet to the basics of
	Hebrew nouns and verbs. In the second semester the emphasis will
	fall on less regular paradigms (learned inductively) and more
	complicated syntax. The steady acquisition of vocabulary will be
	emphasized across both semesters.

	Language learning is hard work. It can also be fun and gratifying.
	To aid in the enjoyment, we will sing songs together, memorize and
	recite passages of scripture, and assist one another in a variety of
	ways as we undertake the necessary drills and repetitions.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

The grade structure for \ccode has the following elements.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item
    Students are expected to complete all lessons and exercises from
    \cite{bbh}, and to study and master all sections (\S) from
    \cite{tm}. \textbf{Quizzes} based on the weekly assignments will be
    given regularly. Some of these may come directly from \cite{bbh}.
 \item
   A cumulative \textbf{midterm exam} (take home) is due by the end of reading week.
 \item
   A comprehensive \textbf{final exam} (take home) is due by the end of the last week of class.
\end{enumerate}

The breakdown for the semester's total work is shown in
\autoref{distribution}.
