\cdescription{% copy from the current Academic Calendar
	What is the relationship of scripture and theology? Some answers to
	this question start with the Bible, while others begin with
	Christian doctrine, while still others call for a dialectical
	movement between canon and creed. However it is approached, the
	question presents a number of challenges.

	To illustrate the problem in general, and to outline some possible
	solutions, this course highlights a variety of current approaches to
	the Old Testament as the scripture of the Church. Students will
	encounter work by an array of biblical and theological specialists
	who transgress the conventional limits of their disciplines. They
	will study the views of Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and those who
	disavow religious affiliation. Because the Hebrew Bible is Jewish
	scripture in the first instance, students will consider why some
	Jews are not interested in biblical theology, and what it means for
	the Church to adhere to the Scriptures of Israel. Specific doctrines
	under consideration include: creation, sin, election, incarnation
	(the body of God), divine impassibility, Christology, Mariology, law
	and gospel, death and resurrection, and the afterlife.

	By the end of this course students should
		develop knowledge of some ways different churches -- include the RCC, ACC and UCC --
		approach the Bible in general, and the Old Testament in particular, as scripture.
	They should become familiar with
		a few major narratives about the relationship of Bible and Theology, and with
		different theories about how to frame knowledge of God (in terms apophatic and kataphatic, for example).
	They should be able to analyze and evaluate doctrinal claims
		by biblical scholars and theologians who use the OT as a core theological resource.
	Students should also develop curiosity about the role of Hebrew scripture in
		communities beyond the church, including in the academy and especially the synagogue.
		Their creativity and confidence in expressing their own ideas about the Scriptures of Israel should grow,
		even as they learn to do so with appropriate humility and charity.
	Finally, students should experience a process of discovery in dialogue with
		biblical traditions ancient and strange as they come to terms with their own ways
		of thinking and speaking about the God of Israel.

available in the library, and it is well worth consulting.

\section{Evaluation and Grade Structure}
\label{evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}% 250*7+250*10 = 4250 words, plus the annotated articles

	\item Before each class, complete the assigned reading and write a
	one page (250 word) \textbf{reading response}. Use the exercise to
	elaborate, reflect on, test, challenge, or extend an idea from the
	reading that you find noteworthy. Type your responses, write in
	complete sentences, and combine those sentences into one or two
	healthy paragraphs. Due at the start of \textbf{each class}, unless
	it is the first class or another graded assignment is due. Students
	who submit fewer than 7 responses cannot earn an “A” for the course.

	\item On a single sheet of paper, annotate a list of between 7 and
	12 essential \textbf{articles of faith} that Christians historically
	derive from Old Testament scripture. For guidance on what counts as
	“essential” you may consult various catechisms (Catholic, Lutheran),
	creeds (Apostles', Nicene, New), and other official documents
	(Articles, Encyclicals, Statements). In your annotations, cite OT
	texts that seem to speak to each of the doctrines you select,
	whether for or against or both. Due at the start of \textbf{class
	four}.

	\item A \textbf{final paper} allows you to explore one Christian
	Doctrine of your choice in terms of its relationship to Old
	Testament scripture. The paper must have a clear thesis and be 2,500
	words (ten pages) long. It should interact with the assigned reading
	and cite at least seven secondary sources in total. Due at the start
	of the \textbf{last class}.

\end{enumerate}

Note that this course is an intensive. Its format is highly condensed.
In a two week period students are expected to attend 30 hours of class
and to spend a further 50 hours \emph{or more} in independent study.
Students are therefore encouraged not to have other major commitments
during the course session so that they can have the best chance of
success.

The breakdown for the course's total work is shown in
\autoref{grade-dist}.
