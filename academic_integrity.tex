\subsection{Academic Integrity}
\label{integrity}

Integrity in academic work is required of all students. Academic dishonesty
is any breach of this integrity. It includes such practices as cheating (the
use of unauthorized material on tests and examinations), submitting the same
work for different classes without permission of the instructors, using false
information in an assignment (including false references to secondary sources),
improper or unacknowledged collaboration with other students, and plagiarism.

Tyndale takes seriously its responsibility to uphold academic integrity,
and to apply consequences for academic dishonesty. Consult \SecAC\ for more
information on the school's policy and its application to your work in this
course.
