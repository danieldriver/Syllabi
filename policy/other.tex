\section{Other Course Policy}
\label{policy}

Late work will not be accepted, except in genuinely extenuating
circumstances. Students must submit something before the deadline if
they wish to receive credit. Unless I state otherwise, written
assignments are to be uploaded by 11:59 \PM\ on the date indicated.

Essay submissions must be typewritten, double-spaced, and formatted as
PDFs. They should be free from error. In this course they should follow
SBL Style (see \cite{sbl2} in \autoref{supplementary}, above). As a
reminder, AST also upholds an Inclusive Language Policy.

\href{http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx}{Plagiarism},
if \href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/german-education-minister-quits-phd-plagiarism}{detected},
will result in failure of the course.

Students should request permission to record a class or lecture. If
permission is granted, or if recordings are provided (as in the case of
an online course), I stipulate that all recordings be for personal use
only. They may not be shared or distributed.

If you have abilities or disabilities that require modifications to the
assessment process or other aspects of this course, please advise the
course instructor as soon as possible.

Finally, I encourage the conscientious use of laptops, tablets, and
other technology in my classes. In classroom settings, realize that, as
\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.003}{cognitive
psychologists have demonstrated}, ``laptop multitasking hinders
classroom learning for both users and nearby peers.'' Do your part to
foster an environment of open dialogue by honouring the presence of your
classmates. In online settings, consider both the physical environment
in which you choose to work and the virtual environment that you help
create through your participation in various forums. Let your engagement
in this course be marked by rigour and charity alike.
