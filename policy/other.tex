\section{Other Course Policy}
\label{policy}

Late work will not be accepted, except in genuinely extenuating
circumstances. Students must submit something before the deadline if
they wish to receive credit. Unless I state otherwise, assignments are
to be uploaded by 11:59 \PM\ (Atlantic) on the date indicated.

Essay submissions must be typewritten, double-spaced, and formatted as
PDFs. They should be free from error. In this course they should follow
SBL Style (see \cite{sbl2} in \autoref{supplementary}, above). As a
reminder, AST also upholds an Inclusive Language Policy.

Plagiarism is the

to \href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/german-education-minister-quits-phd-plagiarism}{attribute}
(by means of footnotes when writing or aloud when speaking) any ideas,
phrases, sentences, materials, syntheses, et cetera, that another author
has composed and that you have borrowed for your own work. Plagiarism is
unethical. Academic penalties for plagiarism at AST are serious, and may
include failure of the course or even suspension of further studies.
Unintentional plagiarism is considered plagiarism. AST's Plagiarism
Policy is found under that heading in the Academic
Calendar.\footnote{This paragraph is adapted from standard language
provided by the Academic Dean's office.}

Students should request permission to record a class or lecture. If
permission is granted, or if recordings are provided (as in the case of
an online or hybrid course), I stipulate that all recordings be for
personal use only. They may not be shared or distributed.

If you have needs that require modifications to any aspect of this
course, please consult with the instructor as soon as possible. Any
documentation regarding disabilities that you wish to divulge to AST
should be provided to the Registrarâ€™s Office, where it will be kept in a
confidential file.\footnotemark[1]

Finally, I encourage the conscientious use of laptops, tablets, and
other technology in my classes. In classroom settings, realize that, as
\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.003}{cognitive
psychologists have demonstrated}, ``laptop multitasking hinders
classroom learning for both users and nearby peers.'' Do your part to
foster an environment for dialogue by honouring the presence of your
classmates. In online and hybrid settings, consider both the physical
environment in which you choose to work and the virtual environment that
you help create through your participation in various forums. Let your
engagement in this course be marked by rigour and charity alike.
