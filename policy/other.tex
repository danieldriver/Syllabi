\section{Other Course Policy}
\label{policy}

Late work will not be accepted, except in genuinely extenuating
circumstances.

Essay submissions must be typewritten, double-spaced, and free from
error. In this course they should follow the \emph{SBL Handbook of Style},
2nd Edition (refer to the free, online \href{https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/SBLHSsupp2015-02.pdf}{Student Supplement}).
\href{http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx}{Plagiarism},
if \href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/german-education-minister-quits-phd-plagiarism}{detected},
will result in failure of the course.

Students should request permission to record a class. If permission is
granted, I stipulate that the recording be for personal use only. It may
not be shared or distributed.

Finally, as \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.003}{cognitive
psychologists have demonstrated}, ``laptop multitasking hinders
classroom learning for both users and nearby peers.'' I therefore
encourage the conscientious use of laptops, tablets, and other
technology in the classroom. Please do your part to foster an
environment of open dialogue by honouring the presence of your
classmates.
