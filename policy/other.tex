\section{Other Policy}
\label{policy}

Late work will not be accepted, except in genuinely extenuating
circumstances.

Essay submissions must be typewritten, double-spaced, and free from
error. In this course they should follow the \emph{SBL Handbook of Style},
2nd Edition (refer to the free, online \href{https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/SBLHSsupp2015-02.pdf}{Student Supplement}).
\href{http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx}{Plagiarism},
if \href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/german-education-minister-quits-phd-plagiarism}{detected},
will result in failure of the course.

Students should request permission to record a class. If permission is
granted, I stipulate that the recording be for personal use only. It may
not be shared or distributed.

Finally, as \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.003}{cognitive
psychologists have demonstrated}, ``laptop multitasking hinders
classroom learning for both users and nearby peers.'' I therefore
discourage the use of laptops in the classroom, except to facilitate
presentation.

%There is little new in their finding that the allegedly multitasking
%student does less well in class (11\% worse on the quiz in their
%experiment). This effect has been shown many times. Rather, their novel
%discovery is that classmates \emph{without} laptops who sat with a
%\emph{view} of another student's screen did worse than the students who
%had a computer (17\% worse than those with no laptop in sight).
