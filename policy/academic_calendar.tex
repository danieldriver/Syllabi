\ProvidesFile{academic_calendar.tex}[2013/08/19 v1.0 -- Course policy]

\newcommand{\AC}{Academic Calendar}
\newcommand{\SecAC}{Section~5 of the \AC}

All policy in Sections~\ref{policy}, \ref{expectations} and \ref{support} of
this syllabus applies to this course in addition to policy in the current
\href{http://www.tyndale.ca/registrar/calendar}{\AC}. In some cases the
syllabus underscores the general policy, while in other cases it supersedes it.

For all matters not covered in this syllabus, refer to \SecAC, ``University
College Academic Policies, Procedures, and Notices.'' Students are strongly
encouraged to read this document carefully at least once in their career at
Tyndale, and to review it every year they matriculate.
