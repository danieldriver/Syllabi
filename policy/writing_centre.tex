\subsection{Tyndale Writing Centre}
\label{writing_centre}

Through a combination of tutorials, workshops and resources, Tyndale's Writing
Centre offers a comprehensive program of writing support to Tyndale students,
including individual 30-minute tutoring sessions and guided access to a variety
of writing tools. Students may bring in essays that have been graded (and, for
my classes at least, work that is in process but has not yet been submitted for
a grade) to receive detailed suggestions about how to improve their writing. The
service is available by appointment and at no charge.

Formal referrals to the Writing Center, which can come from professors or the
Academic Standards Committee, may feel punitive. However, as someone who was
once student director of his college's Writing Centre, and who sometimes uses
Tyndale's for feedback on his own work in progress, I must emphasize that peer
review is not just for marginal students. Experienced writers learn to crave
good feedback. Think you don't need the Writing Centre? I challenge you to make
two appointments this semester. See if the service it provides might not
contribute to your education here after all.
