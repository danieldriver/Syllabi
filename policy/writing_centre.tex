\subsection{Tyndale Writing Centre}
\label{writing_centre}

Through a combination of tutorials, workshops and resources, Tyndale's Writing
Centre offers a comprehensive program of writing support to Tyndale students,
including individual 30-minute tutoring sessions, workshops, handbooks and
other writing resources. Students may bring essays that have been graded (and,
at least for my classes, work that is in process but has not yet been submitted
for a grade) and will receive detailed suggestions for improving their writing.
This service, at no charge to students, is available by appointment.

Professors may recommend that a student go to the Writing Centre for help:
students are strongly encouraged to follow such recommendations. The Academic
Standards Committee may require an undergraduate student who is experiencing
difficulty in his or her academic program to go to the Writing Centre for
assistance and support.

As someone who cares a great deal about writing, and was student director
of his college Writing Center (\emph{sic}), I must emphasize that getting
competent feedback on writing is not just for marginal students. Outstanding
writers learn to crave good feedback. Think you don't need the Writing Centre?
Make two appointments this semester. See if the service it provides might not
contribute to your education here after all.
