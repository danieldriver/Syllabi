AST's \href{https://www.astheology.ns.ca/students/resources.html}{Academic
Calendar} provides guidelines and criteria for academic assessment. Marks are
assigned by letter grade using these benchmarks. Note that graduate and
undergraduate programs are currently assessed on a different scales at AST (see
\autoref{grade-syst}). For graduate students, a grade of C is deemed
``Unsatisfactory,'' whereas for undergraduate (BTh) students, a C is
``Satisfactory'' and the grade of D is possible for ``Marginal'' performance.
Other grades have different definitions, too.
