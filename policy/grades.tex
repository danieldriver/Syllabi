%\begin{description}
%  \item[A+ (94-100) ‘Exceptional’]
%    A superior performance with consistent evidence of a comprehensive,
%    incisive grasp of all aspects of the subject matter; a very wide
%    knowledge base; insightful critical evaluation and analysis of the
%    material; an exceptional capacity for original, creative, and/or
%    logical thinking; an exceptional ability to organize, analyse,
%    synthesize, and to express thoughts fluently.
%  \item[A (87-93) ‘Outstanding’]
%    A comprehensive grasp of the subject matter, outstanding evidence of
%    original thought; sound critical evaluation of the material; an
%    excellent ability to organize, analyse, synthesize and to express
%    thoughts; mastery of an extensive knowledge base.
%  \item[A- (80-86) ‘Excellent’]
%    All the qualities of a B-level performance and an excellent capacity
%    for original, creative, and/ or logical thinking; excellent ability
%    to organize, analyse, synthesize, and integrate ideas; broad
%    knowledge base in the subject matter.
%  \item[B+ (77-79) ‘Good’]
%    A good performance with substantial knowledge of the subject matter;
%    a very good understanding of the relevant issues; familiarity with
%    relevant literature and techniques; good ability to organize,
%    analyse, and examine the material in a constructive and critical
%    manner.
%  \item[B (73-76) ‘Acceptable’]
%    A generally adequate performance with a good knowledge of the
%    subject matter; a fair understanding of relevant issues; some
%    ability to work with relevant literature and techniques; some
%    ability to develop solutions to difficult problems related to the
%    subject material.
%  \item[B- (70-72) ‘Marginally Acceptable’]
%    Some familiarity with the subject material; some understanding.
%    Satisfactory understanding of relevant issues; attempts to solve
%    moderately difficult problems related to the subject material in a
%    critical and analytical manner are only partially successful.
%  \item[C (60-69) ‘Unsatisfactory’]
%    A C grade indicates unsatisfactory academic performance. At the
%    discretion of the instructor, supplemental work may be negotiated to
%    upgrade the mark to a B range. A student may carry two C grades
%    without penalty in all courses except Foundations Courses,
%    Supervised Field Education, Supervised Ministry Practicum and the
%    Graduate Project. In these courses, a minimum grade of B- is
%    required to graduate. A student who receives a C in a Foundation
%    course must repeat the course to achieve a B- or better, and cannot
%    use the C grade to meet prerequisite requirements for advanced
%    courses. If the student repeats one of these courses and receives a
%    B- or better, the previous C grade remains on the transcript and can
%    be counted toward the total of unsatisfactory grades that may lead
%    to academic dismissal. Credit will be given only once for any
%    course. (See Policy on Unsatisfactory Academic Performance in the
%    AST Student Handbook.)
%  \item[F (0-59) ‘Failure’]
%    Student has not grasped subject matter; does not understand issues
%    involved; cannot work with relevant literature. (See Policy on
%    Unsatisfactory Academic Performance in the AST Student Handbook.)
%  \item[P ‘Pass’]
%    Credit awarded, but no mark assigned.
%  \item[FP ‘Failure due to Plagiarism’]
%    A student will receive this grade only after proven incident(s) of
%    plagiarism in a course.
