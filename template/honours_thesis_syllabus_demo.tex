  Students complete a major research project in Biblical Studies and
  Theology that demonstrates the ability to formulate a research
  question or thesis, use current scholarly methods and theories,
  critically evaluate primary sources and/or research data, and come to
  responsible conclusions. The honours thesis is a six-credit-hour
  course.

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{outcomes}

% A Model of Learning Objectives
% Adapted from http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
%
% A learning objective should contain a *subject* (a verb related to
% cognitive process) and an *object* (a noun identifying the knowledge
% or skill sought). Statements should be precise and measurable, e.g.,
% "By the end of this course, students will be able to <verb> <noun>."
%
% Anderson and Krathwohl name four *classes of knowledge* that students
% can be expected to acquire. Terms move from the concrete to the
% abstract:
%
%   1. factual           (basic elements, details, terminology)
%   2. conceptual        (interrelationship of basic elements)
%   3. procedural        (skills, methods, techniques, criteria)
%   4. metacognitive     (strategy, context and conditions, self-knowledge)
%
% Metacognitive knowledge is a special case. It concerns one's own
% "cognition and about oneself in relation to various subject matters"
% (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, p.44).
%
% A&K also identify 19 *cognitive processes*, arranged in six categories
% (a 2001 revision of Bloom's 1957 taxonomy) that progress from lower
% order to higher order thinking skills (from LOTS to HOTS):
%
%   1. remember
%      * recognizing     (identifying)
%      * recalling       (retrieving)
%   2. understand
%      * interpreting    (clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating)
%      * exemplifying    (illustrating, instantiating)
%      * classifying     (categorizing, subsuming)
%      * summarizing     (abstracting, generalizing)
%      * inferring       (concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting)
%      * comparing       (contrasting, mapping, matching)
%      * explaining      (constructing models)
%   3. apply
%      * executing       (carrying out)
%      * implementing    (using)
%   4. analyze
%      * differentiating (discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting)
%      * organizing      (finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring)
%      * attributing     (deconstructing)
%   5. evaluate
%      * checking        (coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing)
%      * critiquing      (judging)
%   6. create
%      * generating      (hypothesizing)
%      * planning        (designing)
%      * producing       (constructing)
%
% If you reference a List of Measurable Verbs Used to Assess Learning
% Outcomes, remember that A&K reverse Bloom's 6th and 5th categories.

The learning outcomes for this course are to be drawn up by the student,
in consultation with the professor, in the first month of the fall
semester. Refer to the following Model of Learning Objectives, to be
introduced by the professor at the first meeting:
\url{http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html}

In addition to these more general aims, the student needs to frame a
research question, and to outline the method by which it will be
addressed. This should be done early in the first semester, and should
be reviewed and revised at the end of the first semester.

\section{Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

The student is responsible for procuring the necessary materials. Make
thorough use of Tyndale's library resources, including its Interlibrary
Loan Form: \url{http://www.tyndale.ca/library/loan}

By the midterm of the first semester the student needs to draw up, and
to present to the professor for approval, a comprehensive bibliography
for the chosen subject.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

If desired, the student or the professor may recommend a book to read
through together. Ideally, this could be done in the semester or summer
before work on the Honours Thesis begins.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

%\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
%\label{structure}

% Please consider the following structure in your course. Evaluation
% should be clearly linked to Learning Outcomes.
%   - Some form of meaningful evaluation should occur during the first 4
%     weeks of the course; **all students should (and first-year
%     students must) receive an indication of their performance in the
%     first half of the course.**
%   - **Plan your assignments so that each can be returned to students
%     before the next is due.**
%   - Most courses should have a rigorous final exam of 2--3 hours
%     duration. Some upper-year courses may not require a final,
%     depending on pedagogical design and assessment strategy. **Final
%     exams should be appropriately demanding in both breadth and depth
%     to assess accurately the achievement of learning outcomes.**
%   - **No assignments should be due in the last week of classes; final
%     examinations will be scheduled only by the Registrar’s Office.**

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Within the first month the student is to draft and submit
   projected \textbf{learning outcomes}. The professor may amend, revise
   or otherwise contribute to this statement.
 \item Also within the first month the student needs to draw up a clear
   \textbf{statement of the research question}. This must include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a 150 word abstract summarising the research for a general audience;
  \item a draft statement of research, not longer than two pages, that indicates how the question will be addressed;
  \item and a revision of both of the above.
 \end{itemize}
 The first draft is due at midterm, the final draft at the end of the first semester.
 \item Early in the first semester, no later than week six, the student needs to compile a comprehensive bibliography. This shall be submitted to the professor for comment and approval.
 \item By finals week the student needs to submit an outline of the entire work and a rough draft of at least one chapter of the thesis.
\end{enumerate}

In the event that the student does not complete the examination, the breakdown for the first semester's work will be as follows:

\begin{table}[htbp]

  \begin{tabular}{lr}
    \toprule
    Learning Outcomes & 10\% \\

%Readings of a given day should be completed before the start of class
%on the same date. Primary readings are compulsory. Any supplementary
%readings that I circulate (see Section~\ref{supplementary}) will
%be keyed to the session number (listed under \textbf{\S} in
%Table~\ref{schedule}), and should ideally be read before class as well.
%We will adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, though I reserve
%the right to adjust it to suit the needs of the class.
