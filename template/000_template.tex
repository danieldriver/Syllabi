% ATS-AST Goals and Assessment Tool
%
% 1. Substantial grounding in critical analytical skills central to
% theological disciplines and their contemporary practice: biblical,
% theological, pastoral;
%
% 2. Cultivate excellence in practices of communicating faith that
% bridge traditional and contemporary styles, genres, and media;
%
% 3. Inculcating habits of bringing critical self-awareness and
% social-awareness to pastoral leadership, fostering virtues crucial in
% times of foundational change such as, ingenuity, compassion and
% courage;
%
% 4. Nurture a committed love of learning and spiritual formation
% understood as integral to pastoral professional practice.
%
% Religious Heritage (Standard A, Section 3.1.1), Cultural Context
% (Standard A, Section 3.1.2), Personal and Spiritual Formation
% (Standard A, Section 3.1.3), and Capacity for Ministerial and Public
% Leadership (Standard A, Section 3.1.4)
%
% Rubric for Assessment: Needs Work; Satisfactory; Doing Well

Students should also be able to:
	name;
	give;

% A Model of Learning Objectives
% Adapted from http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
%
% A learning objective should contain a *subject* (a verb related to
% cognitive process) and an *object* (a noun identifying the knowledge
% or skill sought). Statements should be precise and measurable, e.g.,
% "By the end of this course, students will be able to <verb> <noun>."
%
% Anderson and Krathwohl name four *classes of knowledge* that students
% can be expected to acquire. Terms move from the concrete to the
% abstract:
%
%   1. factual           (basic elements, details, terminology)
%   2. conceptual        (interrelationship of basic elements)
%   3. procedural        (skills, methods, techniques, criteria)
%   4. metacognitive     (strategy, context and conditions, self-knowledge)
%
% Metacognitive knowledge is a special case. It concerns one's own
% "cognition and about oneself in relation to various subject matters"
% (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, p.44).
%
% A&K also identify 19 *cognitive processes*, arranged in six categories
% (a 2001 revision of Bloom's 1957 taxonomy) that progress from lower
% order to higher order thinking skills (from LOTS to HOTS):
%
%   1. remember
%      * recognizing     (identifying)
%      * recalling       (retrieving)
%   2. understand
%      * interpreting    (clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating)
%      * exemplifying    (illustrating, instantiating)
%      * classifying     (categorizing, subsuming)
%      * summarizing     (abstracting, generalizing)
%      * inferring       (concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting)
%      * comparing       (contrasting, mapping, matching)
%      * explaining      (constructing models)
%   3. apply
%      * executing       (carrying out)
%      * implementing    (using)
%   4. analyze
%      * differentiating (discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting)
%      * organizing      (finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring)
%      * attributing     (deconstructing)
%   5. evaluate
%      * checking        (coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing)
%      * critiquing      (judging)
%   6. create
%      * generating      (hypothesizing)
%      * planning        (designing)
%      * producing       (constructing)
%
% If you reference a List of Measurable Verbs Used to Assess Learning
% Outcomes, remember that A&K reverse Bloom's 6th and 5th categories.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}

The following texts are required. Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase their own copies. Library copies that are not reference works
have been placed on a 2-hour reserve.

Students should also have a good, modern translation of the Bible, such
as the NRSV or NJPS. If you want a study Bible, I recommend either
Michael Coogan et al., eds., \emph{The New Oxford Annotated Bible: NRSV
with Apocrypha} (5th ed.; Oxford: OUP, 2018) or, with some superior
notes and essays but neither Apocrypha nor NT, Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi
Brettler, eds., \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition} (2nd ed.;
Oxford: OUP, 2014).

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings may be recommended throughout the semester.
Excerpts from this literature will either be placed on reserve or made
available through the course website.

In addition, the following reference works are worth owning and
consulting. First, \cite{rlgs} includes sound advice on things like
reading religious texts, writing essays and book reviews, making oral
presentations, and learning languages. Second, \cite{sbl2} is a standard
reference in the field, useful to beginning students and specialists in
biblical studies alike.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item A \textbf{book review} will facilitate student reflection on a
	work of biblical interpretation, in this case by \cite{vonrad}. Note
	that a book review is not the same thing as a book report. At least
	half of this paper should be devoted to analysis and evaluation. Its
	total length should be 1,000 words, and it is due on the third day
	of class.

	\item An \textbf{exegetical essay} will facilitate direct engagement
	with the biblical text. The first task is to identify an appropriate
	text. Select a suitably short passage from Exodus. Then, conduct an
	analysis and explication of it. Interact with \cite{childs} and at
	least one other commentator as you work, but be sure not to loose
	sight of the text itself. The paper should be 1,500 words long, and
	it is due on the sixth day of class.

	\item A \textbf{final thesis} gives students an opportunity to
	develop their own answer to the question “Who is Moses?” The paper
	must have a clear thesis, which should govern the entire discussion.
	The paper should also show an awareness of all assigned readings and
	any relevant lectures and classroom discussions. It should be 2,000
	words long, and it is due at the start of the last class.

%\Int{
%	\item Each student will \textbf{make an online presentation} \ldots
