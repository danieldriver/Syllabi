% A Model of Learning Objectives
% Adapted from http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
%
% A learning objective should contain a *subject* (a verb related to
% cognitive process) and an *object* (a noun identifying the knowledge
% or skill sought). Statements should be precise and measurable, e.g.,
% "By the end of this course, students will be able to <verb> <noun>."
%
% Anderson and Krathwohl name four *classes of knowledge* that students
% can be expected to acquire. Terms move from the concrete to the
% abstract:
%
%   1. factual           (basic elements, details, terminology)
%   2. conceptual        (interrelationship of basic elements)
%   3. procedural        (skills, methods, techniques, criteria)
%   4. metacognitive     (strategy, context and conditions, self-knowledge)
%
% Metacognitive knowledge is a special case. It concerns one's own
% "cognition and about oneself in relation to various subject matters"
% (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, p.44).
%
% A&K also identify 19 *cognitive processes*, arranged in six categories
% (a 2001 revision of Bloom's 1957 taxonomy) that progress from lower
% order to higher order thinking skills (from LOTS to HOTS):
%
%   1. remember
%      * recognizing     (identifying)
%      * recalling       (retrieving)
%   2. understand
%      * interpreting    (clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating)
%      * exemplifying    (illustrating, instantiating)
%      * classifying     (categorizing, subsuming)
%      * summarizing     (abstracting, generalizing)
%      * inferring       (concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting)
%      * comparing       (contrasting, mapping, matching)
%      * explaining      (constructing models)
%   3. apply
%      * executing       (carrying out)
%      * implementing    (using)
%   4. analyze
%      * differentiating (discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting)
%      * organizing      (finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring)
%      * attributing     (deconstructing)
%   5. evaluate
%      * checking        (coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing)
%      * critiquing      (judging)
%   6. create
%      * generating      (hypothesizing)
%      * planning        (designing)
%      * producing       (constructing)
%
% If you reference a List of Measurable Verbs Used to Assess Learning
% Outcomes, remember that A&K reverse Bloom's 6th and 5th categories.

A very fine alternative study Bible is the NJPS: Adele Berlin and Marc

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings may be recommended throughout the semester.
Excerpts from this literature will either be placed on reserve or made
available through the course website.

In addition, the following reference works are worth owning and
consulting. First, \cite{rlgs} includes sound advice on things like
reading religious texts, writing essays and book reviews, making oral
presentations, and learning languages. Second, \cite{sbl2} is a standard
reference in the field, useful to beginning students and specialists in
biblical studies alike.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item I will set \textbf{reading prompts} throughout the semester.
	They are designed to ensure that you have read the assigned material
	carefully, and to help you explore its significance. Prompt
	responses submitted online should be between 250 and 300 words long.

%	\item Students are to \textbf{memorize ten verses from the Psalms}
%	in the King James Version and recite them to me privately by the
%	last day of class. You may select ten verses from one psalm, one
%	verse from ten psalms, or any combination in between.

	\item Two \textbf{short papers} will facilitate student reflection
	on two extended works of biblical interpretation, one by
	\cite{heschel} and one by \cite{irenaeus}. Each should be 3,000
	words long. They are due on the sixth and eleventh days of class,
	respectively.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item The \textbf{first paper} will articulate and evaluate
		multiple rationales for sabbath observance by interacting with
		biblical and post-biblical traditions. The latter must include,
		but need not be limited to, Heschel's \emph{The Sabbath}.

		\item The \textbf{second paper} will explore Irenaeus' use of
		the Old Testament as Christian scripture by: succinctly
		summarizing \emph{On the Apostolic Preaching}, selecting a
		characteristic example of biblical interpretation in that work,
		and then developing and defending a coherent thesis about that
		instance of interpretation.

	\end{enumerate}

\Int{
	\item Each student will \textbf{make an online presentation} \ldots
}{
	\item Each student will \textbf{lead a seminar} on \ldots
