\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{outcomes}

% A Model of Learning Objectives
% Adapted from http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
%
% A learning objective should contain a *subject* (a verb related to
% cognitive process) and an *object* (a noun identifying the knowledge
% or skill sought). Statements should be precise and measurable, e.g.,
% "By the end of this course, students will be able to <verb> <noun>."
%
% Anderson and Krathwohl name four *classes of knowledge* that students
% can be expected to acquire. Terms move from the concrete to the
% abstract:
%
%   1. factual           (basic elements, details, terminology)
%   2. conceptual        (interrelationship of basic elements)
%   3. procedural        (skills, methods, techniques, criteria)
%   4. metacognitive     (strategy, context and conditions, self-knowledge)
%
% Metacognitive knowledge is a special case. It concerns one's own
% "cognition and about oneself in relation to various subject matters"
% (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, p.44).
%
% A&K also identify 19 *cognitive processes*, arranged in six categories
% (a 2001 revision of Bloom's 1957 taxonomy) that progress from lower
% order to higher order thinking skills (from LOTS to HOTS):
%
%   1. remember
%      * recognizing     (identifying)
%      * recalling       (retrieving)
%   2. understand
%      * interpreting    (clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating)
%      * exemplifying    (illustrating, instantiating)
%      * classifying     (categorizing, subsuming)
%      * summarizing     (abstracting, generalizing)
%      * inferring       (concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting)
%      * comparing       (contrasting, mapping, matching)
%      * explaining      (constructing models)
%   3. apply
%      * executing       (carrying out)
%      * implementing    (using)
%   4. analyze
%      * differentiating (discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting)
%      * organizing      (finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring)
%      * attributing     (deconstructing)
%   5. evaluate
%      * checking        (coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing)
%      * critiquing      (judging)
%   6. create
%      * generating      (hypothesizing)
%      * planning        (designing)
%      * producing       (constructing)
%
% If you reference a List of Measurable Verbs Used to Assess Learning
% Outcomes, remember that A&K reverse Bloom's 6th and 5th categories.

The learning outcomes in this course will be determined by each
student's ability to meet specific goals (learning objectives). By the
end of the course students should be able to:
	name;
	give;
	contrast;
	locate;
	understand;
	recognize;
	list;
	articulate;
	defend;
	classify;
	report on;
	memorize.

Students should also be able to \ldots

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

All required textbooks are available in the Tyndale Bookstore. The
coursepack is available in class, directly from Dr. Driver.

\begingroup
\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}% temporarily remove the section heading
\begin{thebibliography}{Heschel}% use the longest item in the bibliography

	\bibitem[NRSV]{nrsv} \emph{The New Oxford Annotated Bible with
	Apocrypha}. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010
	(4\textsuperscript{th} edition). Many serviceable translations of
	the Bible exist, but I assign the NRSV because it is a standard
	among biblical scholars. If you do not already have a copy then you
	must purchase one for this class.

	\bibitem[Heschel]{heschel} Abraham Joshua Heschel. \emph{The
	Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man}. New York: Farrar, Straus and
	Giroux, 1951 (repr. 2005). Read this classic example of
	20\textsuperscript{th} century Jewish spirituality on your own, no
	later than the fourth week of class. Review it in preparation for
	the class on which it is assigned.

	\bibitem[Moberly]{moberly} R.\,W.\,L. Moberly. \emph{Old Testament
	Theology: Reading the Hebrew Bible as Christian Scripture}. Grand
	Rapids: Baker Academic, 2013. Read these eight essays by a leading
	Old Testament scholar and biblical theologian in parallel with (but
	after completing) the assigned Bible readings.

	\bibitem[OTSIC]{otsic} Daniel R. Driver. \emph{\ctitle\ Introductory
	Coursepack}. Toronto, \csemester. In response to the requests of
	many students I have compiled a pack of notes for my lectures. I
	will circulate the relevant pages before each class. It behooves you
	to gather, annotate, and study this material carefully.

\end{thebibliography}
\endgroup

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings are listed in the bibliographies that follow each
page of notes in the coursepack. Excerpts from this literature,
ordinarily an article or a book chapter per week, will be available for
download through the course website (alternately, some may be placed on
reserve in the library). Students are not strictly required to read this
supplementary material; then again, students who choose not to read it
should not expect to get an A for the course.

Note that the required readings for this survey emphasize a selection of
primary texts from the Old Testament. Reading in the vast body of
secondary literature on the Bible is largely left for upper-division
courses. Diligent students, however, and all prospective majors, will
make a special point of reviewing the supplementary articles.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

% Please consider the following structure in your course. Evaluation
% should be clearly linked to Learning Outcomes.
%   - Some form of meaningful evaluation should occur during the first 4
%     weeks of the course; **all students should (and first-year
%     students must) receive an indication of their performance in the
%     first half of the course.**
%   - **Plan your assignments so that each can be returned to students
%     before the next is due.**
%   - Most courses should have a rigorous final exam of 2--3 hours
%     duration. Some upper-year courses may not require a final,
%     depending on pedagogical design and assessment strategy. **Final
%     exams should be appropriately demanding in both breadth and depth
%     to assess accurately the achievement of learning outcomes.**
%   - **No assignments should be due in the last week of classes; final
%     examinations will be scheduled only by the Registrarâ€™s Office.**

\begin{enumerate}

	\item At various points throughout the semester I will announce
	\textbf{reading quizzes}. They are designed to ensure that you have
	read the assigned material carefully, and may be administered online
	(outside of class) or on paper (in class). Online quizzes are open
	book, but they are timed and limited to a single attempt. Quizzes
	given in class are closed book, and they may not be made up in the
	case of absence.

	\item Students are to \textbf{memorize Psalm 8} in the King James
	Version (KJV) and recite it to me privately, in my office, in the
	fourth or fifth week of class. An online sign-up sheet will be
	posted to the class website in week three.

	\item A \textbf{midterm exam} will be given in class as scheduled in
	the course outline (Section~\ref{outline}). At the instructor's
	option, it may include a take-home writing component.

	\item A comprehensive \textbf{final exam} will be held during the
	exam period as schedule by the Registrar (see Section~\ref{exams}).
	It is designed to assess learning outcomes, i.e., your attainment of
	the objectives in Section~\ref{outcomes}. Test your readiness for
	the final by asking yourself how well you can perform the tasks
	outlined in those paragraphs.

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

Readings should be completed before the start of the class for which
they are assigned. Primary readings (from scripture) and required
secondary texts (Heschel and Moberly) are compulsory. Any supplementary
readings that I circulate (per Section~\ref{supplementary}) will be
keyed to the session number (listed under \textbf{\S} in
Table~\ref{schedule}), and should ideally be read before class as well.
We will adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, though I reserve
the right to adjust it to suit the needs of the class.
