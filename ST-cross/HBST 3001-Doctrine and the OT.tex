\cdescription{% copy from the current Academic Calendar
	What is the relationship of scripture and theology? Some answers to
	this question start with the Bible, while others begin with
	Christian doctrine, while still others call for a dialectical
	movement between canon and creed. However it is approached, the
	question presents a number of challenges.

	To illustrate the problem in general, and to outline some possible
	solutions, this course highlights a variety of current approaches to
	the Old Testament as the scripture of the Church. Students will
	encounter work by an array of biblical and theological specialists
	who transgress the conventional limits of their disciplines. They
	will study the views of Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and those who
	disavow religious affiliation. Because the Hebrew Bible is Jewish
	scripture in the first instance, students will consider why some
	Jews are not interested in biblical theology, and what it means for
	the Church to adhere to the Scriptures of Israel. Specific doctrines
	under consideration include: creation, sin, election, incarnation
	(the body of God), divine impassibility, Christology, Mariology, law
	and gospel, death and resurrection, and the afterlife.

	By the end of this course students should develop knowledge of some
	ways different churches -- including Roman Catholic, Anglican, and
	United -- approach the Bible in general, and the Old Testament in
	particular, as scripture. They should become familiar with some
	leading narratives about the relationship of Bible and Theology, and
	with different theories about how to frame knowledge of God (in
	terms apophatic and kataphatic, for example). They should be able to
	analyze and evaluate doctrinal claims by biblical scholars and
	theologians who use the OT as a core theological resource. Students
	should also develop curiosity about the role of Hebrew scripture in
	communities beyond the church, including in the academy and the
	synagogue. Their creativity and confidence in expressing their own
	ideas about the Scriptures of Israel should grow, even as they learn
	to do so with appropriate humility and charity. Finally, students
	should experience a process of discovery in dialogue with biblical
	traditions ancient and strange as they pursue fresh ways ways of
	thinking and speaking about the God of Israel.

% Evaluation scheme from Summer 2017 intensive
%
%\begin{enumerate}% 200*7+250*8 = 3400 words, plus the annotated articles
%
%	\item Before each class, complete the assigned reading and write a
%	200--250 word (one page) \textbf{reading response}. Use the exercise
%	to elaborate, reflect on, test, challenge, or extend an idea from
%	the reading that you find noteworthy. Type your responses, write in
%	complete sentences, and combine those sentences into one or two
%	healthy paragraphs. Due at the start of \textbf{each class}, unless
%	it is the first class or another graded assignment is due. Students
%	who submit fewer than 6 responses cannot earn an “A” for the course.
%
%	\item On one sheet of paper, annotate a list of between 7 and 12
%	essential \textbf{articles of faith} that Christians associate with
%	Old Testament scripture. For guidance on what counts as “essential”
%	you may consult various catechisms (Catholic, Lutheran), creeds
%	(Apostles', Nicene, New), and other official documents (Articles,
%	Encyclicals, Statements). In your annotations, cite OT texts that
%	seem to speak to each of the doctrines you select, whether for or
%	against or both. Due at the start of \textbf{class four}.
%
%	\item A \textbf{final paper} allows you to explore one Christian
%	Doctrine of your choice in terms of its relationship to Old
%	Testament scripture. The paper must have a clear thesis and be at
%	least 2,000 words (eight pages) long. It should interact with the
%	assigned reading and cite at least four secondary sources in total.
%	Due at the start of the \textbf{last class}.
