	Survey of the redemptive story in the three major divisions of the
	Old Testament (the Law/Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings),
	including an orientation to the historical backgrounds, religious
	context, literary forms, apocryphal dimensions, prophetic elements,
	matters of canon, text, interpretation, and critical issues.

	{\itshape Note that this class is both a general studies requirement
	and a prerequisite for advanced courses in Biblical Studies \&
	Theology.}

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{outcomes}

The learning outcomes for this course are in part a function of each
student's ability to meet specific goals (learning objectives). By the
end of the course students should be able to:
	name major Old Testament people and events;
	identify representative biblical quotes by book and chapter;
	give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from the time of Egypt to Greece;
	locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
	understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders and traditions;
	recognize genres of biblical literature and cite examples from the reading;
%	list the Ten Commandments in order;
	articulate multiple rationales for sabbath observance;
	defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the divine name;
	classify prophetic literature relative to the exile;
	report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets;
	memorize and recite Psalm 8.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these reading communities,
recognize where their own biographies and commitments place them in
relation to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and
test their individual attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to
extend their awareness of the Bible's reading communities to the Bible's
long history of reception. Finally, students should be able to infer
what Jesus might have meant in speaking of ``the law of Moses, the
prophets, and the psalms'' (Luke 24:44), and begin to hear claims about
New Testament fulfilment of scripture in light of the unique voice that
the Old Testament retains along side of the New in Christian scripture.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

All required textbooks are available in the Tyndale Bookstore. The
coursepack is available in class, directly from Dr. Driver.

\begingroup
\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}% temporarily remove the section heading
\begin{thebibliography}{Heschel}% use the longest item in the bibliography

	\bibitem[NJPS]{njps}
	Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, eds.
    \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition}.
    Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2014.
    ISBN 978-0199978465.
	Many serviceable translations of the Bible exist, including the NRSV
	and ESV. The NJPS allows students in this course to better
	appreciate the relationship of the first part of Christian Scripture
	to the Scriptures of Israel (also called the Hebrew Bible), which is
	one of the course's fundamental objectives. In addition, this
	revised study Bible contains an outstanding set of introductory
	notes and essays in a highly readable, single-column format. It is
	required.


%	\bibitem[Heschel]{heschel} Abraham Joshua Heschel. \emph{The
%	Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man}. New York: Farrar, Straus and
%	Giroux, 1951 (repr. 2005). Read this classic example of
%	20\textsuperscript{th} century Jewish spirituality on your own, no
%	later than the fourth week of class. Review it in preparation for
%	the class on which it is assigned.

	\bibitem[OTSIC]{otsic} Daniel R. Driver. \emph{\ctitle\ Introductory
	Coursepack}. Toronto, \csemester. In response to the requests of
	many students I have compiled a pack of notes for my lectures. I
	will circulate the relevant pages before each class. It behooves you
	to gather, annotate, and study this material carefully.

\end{thebibliography}

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings are listed in the bibliographies that follow each
page of notes in the coursepack. Excerpts from this literature,
ordinarily an article or a book chapter per week, will either be made
available for download through the course website, or else be designated
from the introductory essays included in the NJPS Study Bible. Students
are not strictly required to read this material; then again, students
who choose not to read it should not expect to get an A for the course.

Note that the required readings for this survey emphasize a selection of
primary texts from the Old Testament. Reading in the vast body of
secondary literature on the Bible is largely left for upper-division
courses. Diligent students, however, and all prospective majors, will
make a special point of reviewing the designated supplementary texts.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item At various points throughout the semester I will announce
	\textbf{reading quizzes}. They are designed to ensure that you have
	read the assigned material carefully, and may be administered online
	(outside of class) or on paper (in class). Online quizzes are open
	book, but they are timed and limited to a single attempt. Quizzes
	given in class are closed book, and they may not be made up in the
	case of absence.

	\item Students are to \textbf{memorize Psalm 8} in the King James
	Version (KJV) and recite it to me privately, in my office, in the
	fourth or fifth week of class. An online sign-up sheet will be
	posted to the class website in week three.

	\item A \textbf{midterm exam} will be given in class as scheduled in
	the course outline (Section~\ref{outline}). At the instructor's
	option, it may include a take-home writing component.

	\item A comprehensive \textbf{final exam} will be held during the
	exam period as schedule by the Registrar (see Section~\ref{exams}).
	It is designed to assess learning outcomes, i.e., your attainment of
	the objectives in Section~\ref{outcomes}. Test your readiness for
	the final by asking yourself how well you can perform the tasks
	outlined in those paragraphs.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

Readings should be completed before the start of the class for which
they are assigned. Primary readings (from scripture) and required
secondary texts (Heschel and Moberly) are compulsory. Any supplementary
readings that I circulate (per Section~\ref{supplementary}) will be
keyed to the session number (listed under \textbf{\S} in
Table~\ref{schedule}), and should ideally be read before class as well.
We will adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, though I reserve
the right to adjust it to suit the needs of the class.
