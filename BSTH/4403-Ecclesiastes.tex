\cdescription{% copy from tyndale.ca/registrar/calendar
	A seminar style course involves the advanced study of a particular
	topic or figure in biblical theology that will change from year to
	year. It can be taken more than once for credit, provided that the
	topics are different. Students will be expected to contribute to the
	seminar by doing research and presenting the results to the seminar.
	Prerequisites: \textsc{bsth} 101, 102, 201 and 270.

\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html

In this course Ecclesiastes will be studied in the context of other
biblical literature, with some reference to extra-biblical sources, and
in connection with the book's reception history. By the end of the
course students should be able to:
	list biblical books classified with the Writings and wisdom literature;
	understand differences in the way this literature is classified;
	give examples of extra-biblical parallels to wisdom literature;
	locate Ecclesiastes relative to other Solomonic literature;
	recognize quotes from Ecclesiastes by chapter;
	name major ancient and modern commentators on Ecclesiastes;
	report on specific commentators verbally;
	articulate interpretive options in reading Ecclesiastes;
	defend their own preferred readings in writing, with detailed textual support.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Students must have access to a Study Bible.Â I recommend \emph{The New
Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha: New Revised Standard Version}
(Oxford University Press, 2010) or \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second
Edition} (Oxford University Press, 2014) if you need to acquire one.
Many serviceable English translations of the Bible exist, but the NRSV
and NJPS are standard among biblical scholars. For this class the ESV is
an acceptable alternative.

Articles and book chapters from the vast literature on Ecclesiastes in
reception, and in the context of the Writings and wisdom literature, may
be recommended and placed on the course website as the semester
progresses. Students are encouraged to pursue secondary literature on
their own as well.

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

Readings should be completed before the start of the class for which
they are assigned. We will adhere to the schedule as closely as
possible, though I reserve the right to adjust it to suit the needs of
the class.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Each class will typically begin with a \textbf{reading quiz}.
	These are designed to ensure that you have read the assigned
	material carefully, and will frequently set a jumping-off point for
	seminar discussions. Quizzes may not be made up in the case of
	absence, though in special cases they may be taken in advance.

	\item The last part of each class will be devoted to a
	\textbf{seminar-style discussion} of one chapter of Ecclesiastes.
	Each student will be assigned a commentator for a period of 3 weeks,
	and they are responsible to report on that commentator and bring
	their insight to bear on the discussion. How should you prepare?

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Read the seminar text closely and carefully. Look for
		distinctive language, themes and images, and stay alert to
		intertextual connections between the main passage and other
		biblical literature. Jot down your observations.

		\item Consult your designated commentary. It should be read
		after you have got a sense for the chapter on its own. One good
		approach might be to read the chapter through twice, making some
		preliminary notes, and then to read your commentator and fill
		out your preliminary notes.

		\item Notes will be collected near the end of the semester, and
		I may ask to see them sooner if there is any doubt about the
		adequacy of your preparation. Remember that you are the resident
		authority on your designated commentator.

	\end{enumerate}

	\item In weeks 7 and 8 students are to present a \textbf{case study}
	to the class. In 12 minutes you must report on and analyze a
	specific instance of the reception of Ecclesiasted in art,
	literature, film, history, theology, philosophy, or public
	discourse. Use half your time for description and summary, and half
	for analysis and critique. Presentations will be evaluated for the
	quality of the selection, and the depth of analysis.

	\item A comprehensive \textbf{final paper} is due at the start of
	the exam period as schedule by the Registrar (see
	Section~\ref{exams}).

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Students are to write an exegetical analysis of (part of)
		Ecclesiastes. In 16--20 pages, each paper must advance a thesis
		about the text and must demonstrate, through careful citation, a
		thorough awareness of relevant commentary and scholarly
		literature.

		\item The instructor may set deadlines for drafts in the second
		part of the semester, and may host a peer review or offer bonus
		points for visits to the writing centre. All studens in this
		class should be prepared to read a 1,000 word excerpt from your
		final submission in the exam period.

	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
