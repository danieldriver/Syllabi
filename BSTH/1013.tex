	Survey of the redemptive story in the three major divisions of the
	Old Testament (the Law/Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings),
	including an orientation to the historical backgrounds, religious
	context, literary forms, apocryphal dimensions, prophetic elements,
	matters of canon, text, interpretation, and critical issues.

	{\itshape Note that this class is both a general studies requirement
	and a prerequisite for advanced courses in Biblical Studies \&
	Theology.}

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{outcomes}

The learning outcomes in this course will be determined by each
student's ability to meet specific goals (learning objectives). By the
end of the course students should be able to:
	name major Old Testament people and events;
	identify representative biblical quotes by book and chapter;
	give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from the time of Egypt to Greece;
	locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
	understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders and traditions;
	recognize genres of biblical literature and cite examples from the reading;
	list the Ten Commandments in order;
	articulate multiple rationales for sabbath observance;
	defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the divine name;
	classify prophetic literature relative to the exile;
	report on apparent parallels, synchronisms, tensions, and contradictions in and across the Law and the Prophets;
	memorize and recite Psalm 8.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these reading communities,
recognize where their own biographies and commitments place them in
relation to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and
test their individual attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to
extend their awareness of the Bible's reading communities to the Bible's
long history of reception. Finally, students should be able to infer
what Jesus might have meant in speaking of ``the law of Moses, the
prophets, and the psalms'' (Luke 24:44), and begin to hear claims about
New Testament fulfilment of scripture in light of the unique voice that
the Old Testament retains along side of the New in Christian scripture.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

All required textbooks are available in the Tyndale Bookstore. The
coursepack is available in class, directly from Dr. Driver.

\begingroup
\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}% temporarily remove the section heading
\begin{thebibliography}{Heschel}% use the longest item in the bibliography

	\bibitem[NRSV]{nrsv} \emph{The New Oxford Annotated Bible with
	Apocrypha: New Revised Standard Version}. Oxford: Oxford University
	Press, 2010 (4\textsuperscript{th} edition). Many serviceable
	translations of the Bible exist, but the NRSV is a standard among
	biblical scholars. If you do not already have a copy then you must
	purchase one for this class.

	\bibitem[Heschel]{heschel} Abraham Joshua Heschel. \emph{The
	Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man}. New York: Farrar, Straus and
	Giroux, 1951 (repr. 2005). Read this classic example of
	20\textsuperscript{th} century Jewish spirituality on your own, no
	later than the fourth week of class. Review it in preparation for
	the class on which it is assigned.

	\bibitem[Moberly]{moberly} R.\,W.\,L. Moberly. \emph{Old Testament
	Theology: Reading the Hebrew Bible as Christian Scripture}. Grand
	Rapids: Baker Academic, 2013. Read these eight essays by a leading
	Old Testament scholar and biblical theologian in parallel with (but
	after completing) the assigned Bible readings.

	\bibitem[OTSIC]{otsic} Daniel R. Driver. \emph{\ctitle\ Introductory
	Coursepack}. Toronto, \csemester. In response to the requests of
	many students I have compiled a pack of notes for my lectures. I
	will circulate the relevant pages before each class. It behooves you
	to gather, annotate, and study this material carefully.

\end{thebibliography}
\endgroup

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings are listed in the bibliographies that follow each
page of notes in the coursepack. Excerpts from this literature,
ordinarily an article or a book chapter per week, will be available for
download through the course website (alternately, some may be placed on
reserve in the library). Students are not strictly required to read this
supplementary material; then again, students who choose not to read it
should not expect to get an A for the course.

Note that the required readings for this survey emphasize a selection of
primary texts from the Old Testament. Reading in the vast body of
secondary literature on the Bible is largely left for upper-division
courses. Diligent students, however, and all prospective majors, will
make a special point of reviewing the supplementary articles.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item At various points throughout the semester I will announce
	\textbf{reading quizzes}. They are designed to ensure that you have
	read the assigned material carefully, and may be administered online
	(outside of class) or on paper (in class). Online quizzes are open
	book, but they are timed and limited to a single attempt. Quizzes
	given in class are closed book, and they may not be made up in the
	case of absence.

	\item Students are to \textbf{memorize Psalm 8} in the King James
	Version (KJV) and recite it to me privately, in my office, in the
	fourth or fifth week of class. An online sign-up sheet will be
	posted to the class website in week three.

	\item A \textbf{midterm exam} will be given in class as scheduled in
	the course outline (Section~\ref{outline}). At the instructor's
	option, it may include a take-home writing component.

	\item A comprehensive \textbf{final exam} will be held during the
	exam period as schedule by the Registrar (see Section~\ref{exams}).
	It is designed to assess learning outcomes, i.e., your attainment of
	the objectives in Section~\ref{outcomes}. Test your readiness for
	the final by asking yourself how well you can perform the tasks
	outlined in those paragraphs.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

Readings should be completed before the start of the class for which
they are assigned. Primary readings (from scripture) and required
secondary texts (Heschel and Moberly) are compulsory. Any supplementary
readings that I circulate (per Section~\ref{supplementary}) will be
keyed to the session number (listed under \textbf{\S} in
Table~\ref{schedule}), and should ideally be read before class as well.
We will adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, though I reserve
the right to adjust it to suit the needs of the class.
