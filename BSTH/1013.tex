\cdescription{% copy from tyndale.ca/registrar/calendar
  Survey of the redemptive story in the three major divisions of the Old
  Testament (the Law/Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings), including
  an orientation to the historical backgrounds, religious context,
  literary forms, apocryphal dimensions, prophetic elements, matters of
  canon, text, interpretation, and critical issues.

  {\itshape Note that this class is both a general studies requirement
  and a prerequisite for advanced courses in Biblical Studies \&
  Theology.}

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{outcomes}

The learning outcomes in this course will be determined by each
student's ability to meet specific goals (learning objectives). By the
end of the course students should be able to:
  name major Old Testament people and events;
  identify representative biblical quotes by book and chapter;
  give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of
    superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from the
    time of Egypt to Greece;
  contrast inner- and extra-biblical dating schemes;
  locate ancient Israel on a map;
  understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and
    differentiate it from other canonical orders and traditions;
  recognize genres of biblical literature and cite examples from the
    reading;
  list the Ten Commandments in order;
  articulate multiple rationales for sabbath observance;
  defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the divine name;
  classify prophetic literature relative to the exile;
  report on instances of duplication in both the Law and the Prophets;
  memorize and recite Psalm 8.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these reading communities,
recognize where their own biographies and commitments place them in
relation to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and
test their individual attitudes and assumptions. They should be able
to extend their awareness of the Bible's reading communities to the
Bible's long history of reception. Finally, students should be able to
infer what Jesus might have meant in speaking of ``the law of Moses, the
prophets, and the psalms'' (Luke 24:44), and begin to hear claims about
New Testament fulfilment of scripture in light of the unique voice that
the Old Testament retains along side of the New in Christian scripture.

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

All required texts are available in the Tyndale Bookstore. The course
pack is available in class, directly from Dr. Driver.

\begingroup
\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}% temporarily remove the section heading
\begin{thebibliography}{Heschel}% use the longest item in the bibliography
  \bibitem[ESV]{esv} \emph{The Bible, English Standard Version}.
    Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway, 2001 (rev. 2011). For this class it is
    important to have a common translation of the Bible. I have selected
    the ESV because it is recent, popular, readable and fairly literal.
    The only two allowable substitutions are the versions most cited by
    biblical scholars, namely, the NRSV and the JPS. If you have none of
    these, you should purchase an ESV for this class.
  \bibitem[Heschel]{heschel} Abraham Joshua Heschel.
    \emph{The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man}. New York: Farrar,
    Straus and Giroux, 1951 (repr. 2005). Read this classic example of
    20\textsuperscript{th} century Jewish spirituality on your own, no
    later than the fifth week of class. Review it in preparation for the
    class on which it is assigned.
  \bibitem[Driver]{driver} Daniel R. Driver.
    \emph{\ctitle\ Introductory Course Pack}. Toronto, \csemester.
    In response to the requests of many students, I have compiled a pack
    of notes for this class. I will circulate it in two batches, at the
    beginning and middle of the semester. It behooves you to annotate
    and study this material carefully.
\end{thebibliography}
\endgroup

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings are listed in the bibliographies that follow each
page of notes in the course pack. Excerpts from this literature,
ordinarily an article or a book chapter per week, will be available for
download through the course website (some may be kept on reserve in the
library). Students are not strictly required to read this supplementary
material; then again, students who choose not to read it should not
expect to get an A for the course.

Note that the required readings for this survey emphasize a selection of
primary texts from the Old Testament. Reading in the vast body of
secondary literature on the Bible is largely left for upper-division
courses. Diligent students, however, and all prospective majors, will
make a special point of reviewing the supplementary material carefully,
since they aim at maximum understanding.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item At various points throughout the semester I will announce
   \textbf{reading quizzes}. They are designed to ensure that you have
   read the assigned material carefully, and may be administered online
   (outside of class) or on paper (in class). Online quizzes are open
   book, but they are timed, and only a single attempt is allowed.
   Quizzes given in class may not be made up in the case of absence.
 \item Students are to \textbf{memorize Psalm 8} in the KJV and recite
   it to me privately, in my office, in the fourth or fifth week of
   class. A sign-up sheet will be circulated in week three.
 \item A \textbf{midterm exam} will be given in class as scheduled in
   the course outline (Section~\ref{outline}). At the instructor's
   option, it may include a take-home writing component.
 \item A comprehensive \textbf{final exam} will be held during the exam
   period as schedule by the Registrar (see Section~\ref{exams}). It is
   designed to assess learning outcomes---how well you have obtained the
   objectives outlined in Section~\ref{outcomes}. Test your readiness
   for the final by asking yourself how well you can perform the tasks
   outlined in those paragraphs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

Readings of a given day should be completed before the start of class
on the same date. Primary readings are compulsory. Any supplementary
readings that I circulate (see Section~\ref{supplementary}) will
be keyed to the session number (listed under \textbf{\S} in
Table~\ref{schedule}), and should ideally be read before class as well.
We will adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, though I reserve
the right to adjust it to suit the needs of the class.

\section{Course Bibliography}
\label{bibliography}

An introductory bibliography is provided at the end of each page
of notes in the course pack. Pursue this material as your interest
dictates, or if you wish to check my handling of any of the material
I present. Be sure to pay special attention to items flagged as
supplementary reading (Section~\ref{supplementary}).
