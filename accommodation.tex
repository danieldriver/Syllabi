\subsection{Accommodation}
\label{accommodation}

Students with documented disabilities may be granted special accommodation for
exams, and in some cases for other assignments. It is even possible to get
permission to use a laptop in class (Section~\ref{laptops}), although I will
need to be convinced of the use case. It is up to the student to contact the
Dean of Students as early as possible in the semester---not later than the
second week---and to document the need. The Dean of Students will then advise
each of the student's professors of the accommodations that may be required.
Please note that special arrangements for assignments need to be made with
me well in advance of assignment due dates (Section~\ref{deadlines}). Timely
requests shall not unreasonably be denied.
