\subsection{Attendance}
\label{attendance}

``Faithful attendance at classes is an important indicator of student maturity
and involvement'' (\AC). Remember, too, that you are responsible for everything
that happens in every class. Your best policy is to attend and engage. Please
do not ask me to repeat for your benefit anything I have said in a class you
have missed.

Keeping a record of attendance is mandatory for faculty at Tyndale (in contrast
to many other colleges and universities). The University College publishes
guidelines for how attendance should bear on your final evaluation in a course,
and I adhere to them. Note that four lates equals one absence.

What should you do if you miss an undue number of classes? First, arrange for
a classmate to brief you on the material missed, or get my permission for a
classmate to make a recording for you (see Section~\ref{recording}). Second,
notify the Dean of Students in person or by phone. If illness is the cause you
will need to submit a doctor's certificate upon return. The Dean of Students
will notify your professors of the reason for the absence and suggest that they
take this into consideration when assigning grades.
