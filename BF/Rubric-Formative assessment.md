Feedback: In future, be sure to read the prompt question carefully. Give an adequate amount of time to the primary and secondary reading material, and make a timely submission to the forums.

### Low Pass

Feedback: If this feedback does not make sense to you, talk to the teaching assistant or professor for suggestions about how to do better in future.

### Pass

This submission engages the prompt question and shows evidence of careful reflection. It is clear that the exercise has been taken seriously.

Feedback: Keep up the good work. Know that high passes are rare, but they can be obtained with truly exceptional submissions.

### High Pass

## Reading Prompt assignment for BF 1001 as of Winter 2020

Reading prompts will be given throughout the semester. They are low-risk
writing exercises designed to encourage careful reading of the assigned
material, and to help explore its significance. Individual posts are not
marked, though points may be deducted from your final grade if the
exercise is not taken seriously. In general, prompt responses submitted
online should not exceed 300 words. Try to post the in the morning of
class days, after you do the reading but before you listen to the
lecture. You are invited (but not strictly required) to respond to and
interact with classmates on the forums through the rest of the day.
