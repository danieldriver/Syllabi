\section{Hebrew Bible/Tanakh/Old Testament}

Review HBFB 1–26 and Seitz. Then, write three standalone sentences and one short paragraph related to the most basic terminology for the subject matter of this course.

First, make appropriate use of each of the three phrases “Hebrew Bible,” “Tanakh,” and “Old Testament” in three simple sentence. As you write each one, work to create a context and meaning that is appropriate to each term. For example, it would not be appropriate to write: “Rabbinic Judaism traditionally counts 613 laws in the Old Testament.”

Second, in a short paragraph, reflect on your own relationship to the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh/Old Testament. If you like, you may outline your personal policy for how best to refer to the material we will be considering this semester.

\section{The Aqedah (“Binding” of Isaac)}

Once you have read the entire book of Genesis and the assigned secondary reading, carefully re-read Genesis 22:1–19. Then answer the following question: In what way is the story of the Aqedah (“Binding” of Isaac) the culmination and climax of God’s call to Abraham? It may help to refer back to the original call in Genesis 12:1–3, and to the Abraham cycle between Genesis 12 and 22, but your answer should reflect a careful reading of Genesis 22 above all.


\section{The Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart}

Revisit Exodus 7–11 once you have completed the secondary reading in HBFB 68–70 (“The Hardening of Pharaoh’s Heart and the Meaning of the Plagues”) and the supplementary article by Claire Mathews McGinnis. What are one or two ways in which the theological interpreter of today might make sense of the portrayal of God in Exodus as hardening “the heart of whomever he chooses”?


\section{The Death of Nadab and Abihu}

Kaminsky and Lohr write that “Leviticus is much more than an obscure manual for ancient Israelite priests” (HBFB, p. 82). However, the book does have a reputation of being irrelevant at best, or, at worst, a showcase for why the “Old Testament God” can seem petty and vindictive. Use this prompt as an occasion to think about why Leviticus might be more meaningful than some people suspect, and not just a liability for Jews and Christians. To do so, once you have completed the reading for this week, re-read the story of the sin and death of Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10:1–3. Then, answer the following question as well as you can in a paragraph or two: What does the death of Nadab and Abihu reveal about the God of Israel?


\section{The Shema}

Once you have completed all the assigned reading, take another look at the Shema in Deuteronomy 6:4–9. What does the “oneness” of God (Deut 6:4) have to do with the “love” of God (Deut 6:5), especially in the context of the book of Deuteronomy? Try to ground your answer in the secondary readings. Note that you may have to take a position relative to the options presented there.

If this question seems to difficult, here's a simpler alternative: What are the four main ways that the Shema can be translated in English? What sets each possible understanding apart from the others?

\section{Pass (not set)}

Conquest question? Reflect on the problem of genocide in connection with the ban?

\section{Establishing a Monarchy}

Recall how the problem of succession develops across the first several chapters of 1 Samuel. Eli’s sons are so bad that Samuel is raised up to succeed him instead, but then Samuel’s sons turn out to be wicked as well (1 Samuel 8:1–3), creating a new crisis of leadership. Against this background, the people ask for a king in 1 Samuel 8. Re-read that chapter carefully, and then answer the following question. Why is God prepared to give the people what they want (a king) even though God and Samuel are both opposed to the request? It may help to connect your answer to the secondary reading.


\section{Artful Repetition}

Read “The Techniques of Repetition,” from Chapter 5 of Robert Alter’s classic study The Art of Biblical Narrative (1981). Then, identify and describe an example of artful repetition from your reading of 1 \& 2 Kings. For maximum points, try to build on Alter’s work by identifying a further example of repetition in the Hebrew Bible that is not named in the supplementary reading.


\section{Isaiah in Irenaeus}

NB - Rewrite: Ellen Davis has been substituted for Childs, and Irenaeus has been retired.

%Once you have read the biblical book of Isaiah, and ideally also Childs on Irenaeus as an interpreter of Isaiah, look back at On the Apostolic Preaching (assigned for last week). Then, in anticipation of your final paper, answer the following in 250 words: What is one specific contribution Irenaeus makes, or else what is one problem Irenaeus creates, in early Christian interpretation of Isaiah? Be focussed and specific. Try to cite both Irenaeus and the Book of Isaiah at the point where you identify either a problem or a contribution.


\section{The End of Jonah}

NB - Write: Alan Cooper - In Praise of Divine Caprice. Where does the book of Jonah end? Or something along those lines.

%This is the second-to-last writing prompt. It gives you an opportunity to refine your thesis for your second paper (the paper is due in Week 11, so there will be no writing prompt then). Think of your post this week as an abstract, or as a draft of part of your introductory paragraph. Use your 250 words to give some context for your proposal, but know that a thesis for a paper of this length ought to be just a single sentence.
%
%Your task is this: Craft and propose a thesis that can be supported with a 3000 word argument. Realize that a good thesis is unified, restricted, and precise. Make sure that your thesis touches both on an Old Testament text of your choice, and the interpretation of that text in Irenaeus, On the Apostolic Preaching. (For help on what makes a good thesis, I have attached a handout/worksheet that I used when I was working with college students in Chicago. It shows exactly how the TA and I will evaluate your thesis statements for this exercise.)


\section{Praying the Psalms}


NB - Write: Who is the blessed one of Psalm 1? Or: why are the words of Ps 51 so generic while the psalm's title (superscription) is so very specific?

\section{The Meaning of “Hevel” in Ecclesiastes}

NB - Re-write. What follows is too diffuse. Maybe focus on the simple translation issue of "words" vs "things" in 1:8. Have students argue explain what difference A and B make for understanding the chapter / book.

%Read the entire book of Ecclesiastes (1–12), review the HBFB sidebar “Vanity of Vanities” (pp. 242–243), and then consider the following.
%
%Biblical scholar Michael V. Fox outlines five different translations for the book’s key word, hevel, which literally means “vapor” or “breath.” His major options include:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \emph{Vanity}, which emphasizes the pursuit of “wordy frivolities rather than scriptural values.”
%\item \emph{Futile}, which emphasizes frustrated action and the imbalance between “the productivity of human work and the value of its products.”
%\item \emph{Ephemeral}, which emphasizes the problem of “life’s brevity.”
%\item \emph{Incomprehensible}, which emphasizes the “limitations of human reason,” since the meaning of live is so elusive.
%\item \emph{Absurd} or \emph{senseless}, which emphasizes the  way life is contradictory, “counter-rational,” and “a violation of reason.”
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Based on your recent reading of Ecclesiastes, which definition best seems to capture the meaning of the key term “hevel,” and why? Cite and explain a quote from Ecclesiastes to help defend your choice.
