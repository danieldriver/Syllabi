\cdescription[none. The course is required for 3000-level courses in HB]{% copy from the current Academic Calendar; [] for prereqs
	The First Testament of Christian Scripture is a fundamental part of
	Christian tradition and durable rule of faith and practice. Students in
	this course will be introduced to historical and literary data important
	for understanding the origins of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its
	subsequent function as scripture in a variety of contexts. The outlook
	will be broadly ecumenical, with case studies that exemplify Jewish and
	Christian interpretation.

	The broad sweep of biblical tradition will be presented through a survey
	of representative books from the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. To
	help foster an ecumenical outlook, primary readings from the Bible will
	be supplemented by illustrative commentary from various biblical
	interpreters. Students will develop their exegetical skills by studying
	these examples, and so learn to appreciate the diverse canonical,
	cultural, hermeneutical, historical, literary, and theological elements
	involved in the art of biblical interpretation.
}% end of course description
\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
	By the end of the course students should be able to:
		name major Old Testament people and events;
		locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
		give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the ancient Near Eastern political theatre from Egypt to Greece;
		recognize and cite examples of most genres of biblical literature;
		defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the Divine Name;
		understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
		report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets;
		classify and begin to evaluate a variety of ancient and modern approaches to the Bible.

	Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
	Scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
	academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities, recognize
	where their own biographies place them in relation to the Hebrew
	Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their individual
	attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend their awareness
	of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's long history of
	reception. Finally, students should begin to infer what Jesus meant in
	speaking of “the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms” (Luke
	24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New Testament fulfilment of
	scripture in light of the unique voice that the Old Testament retains
	along side of the New in Christian Scripture.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

The grade structure for \ccode has the following elements.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Notes and quotes} will be solicited from students at
	the start of each class. These are to be drawn from the primary
	reading \cite{njps}. What do you note about the material on this
	occasion? What words, phrases, or ideas stand out to you? Pay
	attention to things you notice from a survey of large sections of
	the Bible. Stay alert, too, to details that strike you from this
	translation. Mark up your Bible. Make notes as you read. Come
	prepared to share highlights with the class.

	\item Two \textbf{oral reflections} give students an opportunity to
	consider their relationship to the Scriptures of Israel and to
	reflect on its development over the course. Each live-voice
	presentation is to last between seven and ten minutes. The first is
	due at the start of the third class; the second is due at the start
	of the last class.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item By the third class, answer the following question:
		\emph{What does my tradition tell me about the Scriptures of
		Israel?} To start, identify a tradition that broadly informs
		your thinking about the Tanakh/OT/HB. Our traditions are often
		multiple, but for the purposes of this assignment, select one
		that is, for you, especially relevant, dominant, or in need of
		investigation. Then, summarize what your tradition says. Focus
		on official statements, where available. You may review informal
		attitudes, too, but keep to things that are identifiable with a
		tradition (not too personal, in other words). Students
		associated with AST's founding parties should consider sources
		like: the Catechism of the Catholic Church; the Thirty-nine
		Articles of Religion; the four subordinate standards of the
		UCCan. Students with other religious affiliation, or with none,
		should consider what pertains to them. (Anglo-American celebrity
		atheists embody a tradition, too, for example.)

		\item By the final class, answer the following question:
		\emph{What would I like to say to my tradition about the
		Scriptures of Israel?} Revisit your first reflection and the
		tradition you identified at the start of the term. Then, as you
		think about what you might want to affirm, critique, or reform
		in that tradition, reflect on what we have studied. Based on
		what you have learned, what is something you would say about the
		Tanakh/OT/HB to others today who are shaped by your tradition?
		If desired, you may craft this statement as words to a peer
		(someone like you before this course) or an open letter or
		address to an authority (an official leader or public figure).
		In your answer, incorporate at least two good examples from the
		Bible. Whether you make points broad or narrow, be sure to cite
		chapter and verse.

	\end{enumerate}

%	\item \textbf{Writing prompts} will be given throughout the
%	semester. They are low-risk writing exercises designed to encourage
%	careful reading of the assigned material, and to help explore its
%	significance. Individual posts are not marked, though points may be
%	deducted from your final grade if the exercise is not taken
%	seriously. Prompt responses submitted online should be around 250
%	words long, and should not exceed 300 words. Try to post the in the
%	morning of class days, after you do the reading but before you
%	listen to the lecture. You are invited (but not strictly required)
%	to respond to and interact with classmates on the forums through the
%	rest of the day.

	\item Two \textbf{exegetical papers} facilitate direct work with the
	biblical text as students practice the art of biblical
	interpretation. Each of these papers should focus on one narrow
	passage and be about \UG{2,000}{3,000} words long, including any
	footnotes. The professor encourages, but does not require, the
	selection of shorter passages from within the focal chapters listed
	in the course outline (\autoref{schedule}). The first paper is due
	before the seventh week; the second paper is due by the last class.

	% Deadlines have sometimes been wks 6 and 11 or else wks 5 and 10
	% depending on scheduling issues. Make sure that what is stated here
	% matches the schedule above.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Before the seventh week, compose and submit an exegetical
		analysis of any suitably short passage from the \textbf{Law}
		(Torah).

		\item Before the last class, compose and submit an
		exegetical analysis of any suitably short passage from the
		\textbf{Prophets} (Former or Latter).

		\item Each paper must advance a \textbf{thesis} related to the
		selected text. This thesis should be clearly identifiable as a
		single sentence in an obvious location. Each paper should
		interact with at least \UG{four (4)}{six (6)} sources or
		commentators, not counting lectures (which do not necessarily
		need to be cited).

		\item See my \href{https://danieldriver.com/assets/pdf/handouts/Guidelines_for_Papers.pdf}{“Guidelines for Papers and Other Written Assignments” (PDF)}.
		See also \cite[chs. 3, 5, 8, 11]{rlgs} and \cite{sbl2}.

	\end{enumerate}

%\Int{
%	\item One week, instead of answering a writing prompt, each student
%	will make an \textbf{online presentation} on one of the twelve
%	supplementary articles. Be creative! It may take the form of a
%	podcast or online video, and should be sharable by URL (try
%	SoundCloud, YouTube, or Vimeo). The presentation should last 8–10
%	minutes (12 min at most). It must begin with a brief (3–5~min)
%	summary of the article. The balance of the time should be spent
%	helping other readers elaborate, reflect on, test, challenge, or
%	extend the main ideas presented there. Post your link to the forums
%	by the morning so that you can help shape the forum discussions on
%	the same article.
%}{
%	\item Each student will lead a \textbf{seminar discussion} of one
%	chapter from the HB/OT, freely chosen from a week's primary reading.
%	The discussion should last about 25~minutes. It needs to begin with
%	a brief (5~min) \textbf{outline} of the chapter. Outlines must be
%	original, not borrowed from commentators. They should be circulated
%	as handouts and explained orally. The balance of the time should be
%	spent helping the class discover, elaborate, reflect on, test, or
%	otherwise explore the meaning of the passage. Critical to success
%	here is the ability to ask good questions of the Bible.
%}

%	\item \textbf{Seminar discussions}: Graduate students will lead
%	\textbf{two} seminar discussions over the course of the semester;
%	undergraduate (BTh) students will lead \textbf{one}. Handouts may be
%	developed and circulated, but they are not required as part of the mark.
%
%
%	\begin{enumerate}
%
%		\item Each student in the course must lead a discussion of one
%		chapter from the primary reading, to occur in the same week in which
%		it is assigned. Any chapter may be selected. Discussion should last
%		twenty minutes. It should begin with a brief overview (five minutes
%		maximum) of the chapter and key issues raised by it. The balance of
%		the time should be spent helping the class discover, elaborate,
%		reflect on, test, or otherwise explore the meaning of the passage.
%		Vital to success here is the ability to ask good questions of the
%		Bible.
%
%		\item Each graduate student must lead a second discussion on a
%		supplementary reading. If the reading selection deviates from what
%		is set in the syllabus, consult with the professor to make sure the
%		alternate reading is circulated at least one week in advance. These
%		seminars, too, should occur in the same week in which the material
%		is assigned and should last twenty minutes. The allocation of time
%		is different, however. Approximately fifteen minutes should be given
%		to summary and analysis, with just five minutes at the end for
%		questions and class discussion. The goal here is for advanced degree
%		students to report on the results of critical inquiries into various
%		noteworthy examples of biblical interpretation.
%
%		\item Students are encouraged to align their essay writing with
%		their seminar topics. For example, it is perfectly acceptable to
%		lead a discussion on the biblical chapter in which the short passage
%		for your exegetical essay appears. It is also acceptable to let
%		class discussion spur revisions to your paper, of course with the
%		understanding that you credit others appropriately for their input.

\section{Further Bibliography}
\label{bib}

Introductions to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament abound. Students looking
for a second or third opinion on basic matters may find one or more the
following volumes useful. They arise from a variety of contexts and, in
terms of orientation, have different kinds of utility. The one by
Kaminsky and Lohr \cite{hbfb} is notable for its brevity and interfaith
outlook.
