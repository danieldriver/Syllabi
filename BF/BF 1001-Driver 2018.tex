\cdescription[none. The course is required for HB courses at or above the 3000-level]{% copy from the current Academic Calendar; [] for prereqs
	The First Testament of Christian Scripture, also called the Hebrew
	Bible or Old Testament, is a fundamental part of Christian tradition
	and durable rule of faith and practice. Students in this course will
	therefore be introduced to historical and literary data important
	for understanding the origins of the Hebrew Bible and its subsequent
	function as Old Testament Scripture in a variety of cultural and
	religious contexts.

	The broad sweep of biblical tradition will be presented through a
	survey of representative books from the Law, the Prophets, and the
	Writings. To help foster an ecumenical outlook, primary readings
	from the Bible will be supplemented by case studies of classic
	Jewish and Christian readings of biblical texts. Students will
	develop their exegetical skills by studying these examples, and so
	learn to appreciate the diverse literary, canonical, cultural,
	historical, hermeneutical, and theological elements involved in
	biblical interpretation. In addition, the course will consider some
	ways that the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament can feature in the practice
	of ministry and in the spiritual practice of faith communities.
}% end of course description
\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
	By the end of the course students should be able to:
		name major Old Testament people and events;
		locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
		give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from Egypt to Greece;
		recognize and cite examples of most genres of biblical literature;
%		defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the divine name;
		understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
		report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets, such as the uses of the Divine Name or the rationales for sabbath observance;
		classify and begin to evaluate a variety of ancient and modern approaches to the Bible.

	Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
	Scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
	academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities,
	recognize where their own biographies place them in relation to the
	Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their
	individual attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend
	their awareness of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's
	long history of reception. Finally, students should begin to infer
	what Jesus meant in speaking of ``the law of Moses, the prophets,
	and the psalms'' (Luke 24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New
	Testament fulfilment of scripture in light of the unique voice that
	the Old Testament retains along side of the New in Christian
	Scripture.

The following texts are required. Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase their own copies. Library copies that are not reference works
have been placed on a 2-hour reserve.

An good alternative study Bible is the NJPS: Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi
Brettler, eds., \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition} (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 2014). A reference copy is available in the
library, and it is well worth consulting.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings will be recommended throughout the semester.
Excerpts from this literature will either be placed on reserve or made
available through the course website. Give this material good effort and
attention. It represents some of the best contemporary readers of the
Bible, and you will not want to miss their hermeneutical and theological
insights.

Also, the following reference works are worth owning and consulting.
\cite{rlgs} in particular contains sound advice on core skills like
reading religious texts, writing essays and reviews, revising essays,
making oral presentations, and learning languages.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Reading prompts} will be given throughout the
	semester. They are low-risk writing exercises designed to encourage
	careful reading of the assigned material, and to help explore its
	significance. They are not marked (although points may be deducted
	if the exercise is not taken seriously), and there is no length
	requirement. In general, prompt responses submitted online should
	not exceed 300 words.

	\item Two \textbf{short papers} will facilitate student engagement
	with the art of biblical interpretation. One is keyed to the
	exposition of a scholar, the other to a short biblical text. Each
	should be about 2,000 words in length. Either paper (your choice) is
	due at the end of the fifth week of class; the remaining one is due
	at the end of the tenth week.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item A \textbf{review essay} invites student reflection on a
		model work of biblical interpretation, to be selected from the
		supplementary articles. Note that a review is not the same thing
		as a report. Devote the first half of the paper to a summary the
		argument under review, and the second half to critical analysis
		and evaluation of the same. Be fair, but do not fail to take a
		position. The paper needs to develop a thesis. See me and
		\cite[Chs 3, 5–7, 11]{rlgs} for guidance.

		\item An \textbf{exegetical essay} provides an opportunity for
		direct work with the biblical text. The first task is to
		identify an appropriate text. Select a suitably short passage
		from the HB/OT. Then, conduct an analysis and explication of it.
		Interact with \cite{hbfb} and at least two other commentators.
		Advance a thesis that relates to the text itself. See me and
		\cite[Chs 3, 5, 8, 11]{rlgs} for guidance.

	\end{enumerate}

\Int{
	\item Each student will \textbf{make an online presentation} on one
	of the twelve supplementary articles. It may take the form of a
	podcast or YouTube video, and should be sharable by URL. The
	discussion, which should last 20 minutes, should begin with a brief
	(5~min) summary of the article. The balance of the time should be
	spent helping other readers elaborate, reflect on, test, challenge,
	or extend the main ideas presented there.
}{
	\item Each student will lead a \textbf{seminar discussion} of one
	chapter from the HB/OT, freely chosen from a week's primary reading.
	The discussion should last about 25~minutes. It needs to begin with
	a brief (5~min) \textbf{outline} of the chapter. Outlines must be
	original, not borrowed from commentators. They should be circulated
	as handouts and explained orally. The balance of the time should be
	spent helping the class discover, elaborate, reflect on, test, or
	otherwise explore the meaning of the passage. Critical to success
	here is the ability to ask good questions of the Bible.
