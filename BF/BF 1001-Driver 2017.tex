\cdescription{% copy from the current Academic Calendar
	The First Testament of Christian Scripture, also called the Hebrew
	Bible or Old Testament, is a fundamental part of Christian tradition
	and durable rule of faith and practice. Students in this course will
	therefore be introduced to historical and literary data important
	for understanding the origins of the Hebrew Bible and its subsequent
	function as Old Testament Scripture in a variety of cultural and
	religious contexts.

	The broad sweep of biblical tradition will be presented through a
	survey of representative books from the Law, the Prophets, and the
	Writings. To help foster an ecumenical outlook, primary readings
	from the Bible will be supplemented by case studies of classic
	Jewish and Christian readings of biblical texts. Students will
	develop their exegetical skills by studying these examples, and so
	learn to appreciate the diverse literary, canonical, cultural,
	historical, hermeneutical, and theological elements involved in
	biblical interpretation. In addition, the course will consider some
	ways that the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament can feature in the practice
	of ministry and in the spiritual practice of faith communities.
}% end of course description
\objectives{% recall Bloom's taxonomy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
	By the end of the course students should be able to:
		name major Old Testament people and events;
		give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from the time of Egypt to Greece;
		locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
		classify prophetic literature relative to the exile;
		recognize genres of biblical literature and cite examples from the reading;
		understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
		defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the divine name;
		report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets;
		articulate multiple rationales for sabbath observance;
		memorize and recite ten verses of a psalm.

	Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
	scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
	academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities,
	recognize where their own biographies place them in relation to the
	Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their
	individual attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend
	their awareness of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's
	long history of reception. Finally, students should begin to infer
	what Jesus meant in speaking of ``the law of Moses, the prophets,
	and the psalms'' (Luke 24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New
	Testament fulfilment of scripture in light of the unique voice that
	the Old Testament retains along side of the New in Christian
	scripture.

An acceptable alternative study Bible is the NJPS: Adele Berlin and Marc
Zvi Brettler, eds., \emph{The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition}
(Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). A reference copy is
available in the library, and it is well worth consulting.

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings will be recommended throughout the semester.
Excerpts from this literature, ordinarily an article or a book chapter
per week, will either be placed on reserve or made available for
download through the course website.

Students are not strictly required to read this additional material;
then again, students who choose not to read it should not expect to
receive an ``A'' for the course.

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

We will adhere to the schedule in \autoref{schedule} as closely as
possible, though the professor reserves the right to adjust it to suit
the needs of the class.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

\subsection{Grade Structure for \ccode}
\label{structure}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item I will set \textbf{reading prompts} throughout the semester.
	They are designed to ensure that you have read the assigned material
	carefully, and to help you explore its significance. Online prompt
	responses should be between 250 and 300 words long.

	\item Students are to \textbf{memorize ten verses from the Psalms}
	in the King James Version and recite them to me privately by the
	last day of class. You may select ten verses from one psalm, one
	verse from ten psalms, or any combination in between.

	\item Two \textbf{short papers} will facilitate student reflection
	on two extended works of biblical interpretation, one by
	\cite{heschel} and one by \cite{irenaeus}. Each should be 3,000
	words long. They are due on the sixth and eleventh days of class,
	respectively.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item The \textbf{first paper} will articulate and evaluate
		multiple rationales for sabbath observance by interacting with
		biblical and post-biblical traditions. The latter must include,
		but need not be limited to, Heschel's \emph{The Sabath}.

		\item The \textbf{second paper} will explore Irenaeus' use of
		the Old Testament as Christian scripture by: succinctly
		summarizing \emph{On the Apostolic Preaching}, selecting a
		characteristic example of biblical interpretation in that work,
		and then developing and defending a coherent thesis about that
		instance of interpretation.

	\end{enumerate}

	\item Each student will \textbf{lead a seminar} on one of the twelve
	supplementary articles. The discussion, which should last 30
	minutes, should begin with a brief (5~min) summary of the article.
	The balance of the time should be spent helping the class elaborate,
	reflect on, test, challenge, or extend the main ideas presented
	there.

\end{enumerate}

The breakdown for the semester's total work is shown in
\autoref{grade-dist}.
