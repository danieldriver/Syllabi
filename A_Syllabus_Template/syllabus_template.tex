  Survey of the redemptive story in the three major divisions of the Old
  Testament (the Law/Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings), including
  an orientation to the historical backgrounds, religious context,
  literary forms, apocryphal dimensions, prophetic elements, matters of
  canon, text, interpretation, and critical issues.

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{outcomes}

% A Model of Learning Objectives
% Adapted from http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/RevisedBlooms1.html
%
% A learning objective should contain a *subject* (a verb related to
% cognitive process) and an *object* (a noun identifying the knowledge
% or skill sought). Statements should be precise and measurable, e.g.,
% "By the end of this course, students will be able to <verb> <noun>."
%
% Anderson and Krathwohl name four *classes of knowledge* that students
% can be expected to acquire. Terms move from the concrete to the
% abstract:
%
%   1. factual           (basic elements, details, terminology)
%   2. conceptual        (interrelationship of basic elements)
%   3. procedural        (skills, methods, techniques, criteria)
%   4. metacognitive     (strategy, context and conditions, self-knowledge)
%
% Metacognitive knowledge is a special case. It concerns one's own
% "cognition and about oneself in relation to various subject matters"
% (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, p.44).
%
% A&K also identify 19 *cognitive processes*, arranged in six categories
% (a 2001 revision of Bloom's 1957 taxonomy) that progress from lower
% order to higher order thinking skills (from LOTS to HOTS):
%
%   1. remember
%      * recognizing     (identifying)
%      * recalling       (retrieving)
%   2. understand
%      * interpreting    (clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating)
%      * exemplifying    (illustrating, instantiating)
%      * classifying     (categorizing, subsuming)
%      * summarizing     (abstracting, generalizing)
%      * inferring       (concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting)
%      * comparing       (contrasting, mapping, matching)
%      * explaining      (constructing models)
%   3. apply
%      * executing       (carrying out)
%      * implementing    (using)
%   4. analyze
%      * differentiating (discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting)
%      * organizing      (finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring)
%      * attributing     (deconstructing)
%   5. evaluate
%      * checking        (coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing)
%      * critiquing      (judging)
%   6. create
%      * generating      (hypothesizing)
%      * planning        (designing)
%      * producing       (constructing)
%
% If you reference a List of Measurable Verbs Used to Assess Learning
% Outcomes, remember that A&K reverse Bloom's 6th and 5th categories.

The learning outcomes in this course will be determined by each
student's ability to meet specific goals (learning objectives). By the
end of the course students should be able to:
  name;
  give;
  contrast;
  locate;
  understand;
  recognize;
  list;
  articulate;
  defend;
  classify;
  report on;
  memorize.

Students should also be able to \ldots

\section{Required Texts \& Materials}
\label{texts}

All required texts are available in the Tyndale Bookstore. The course
pack is available in class, directly from Dr. Driver.

\begingroup
\renewcommand{\section}[2]{}% temporarily remove the section heading
\begin{thebibliography}{Heschel}% use the longest item in the bibliography
  \bibitem[ESV]{esv} \emph{The Bible, English Standard Version}.
    Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway, 2001 (rev. 2011). For this class it is
    important to have a common translation of the Bible. I have selected
    the ESV because it is recent, popular, readable and fairly literal.
    The only two allowable substitutions are the versions most cited by
    biblical scholars, namely, the NRSV and the JPS. If you have none of
    these, you should purchase an ESV for this class.
  \bibitem[Heschel]{heschel} Abraham Joshua Heschel.
    \emph{The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man}. New York: Farrar,
    Straus and Giroux, 1951 (repr. 2005). Read this classic example of
    20\textsuperscript{th} century Jewish spirituality on your own, no
    later than the fifth week of class. Review it in preparation for the
    class on which it is assigned.
  \bibitem[Driver]{driver} Daniel R. Driver.
    \emph{\coursetitle\ Introductory Course Pack}. Toronto, \csemester.
    In response to the requests of many students, I am compiling a pack
    of notes for this class. Since this is still a work in progress,
    I will not be giving out the complete pack at the start of the
    semester. Rather, I will circulate it in several batches. It
    behooves you to gather, keep and study this material (I recommend
    using a small three-ring binder).
\end{thebibliography}
\endgroup

\section{Supplementary Texts}
\label{supplementary}

Supplementary readings are recommended in the bibliography that follows
each page of notes in the course pack. They will ordinarily be available
for download through the course website (some may be kept on reserve
in the library). Students are not required to read the supplementary
material; then again, students who choose not to read it should not
expect to get an A for the course.

Note that the required readings for this survey emphasize a selection
of primary texts from the Old Testament. Reading in the vast body of
secondary literature on the Bible is largely left for upper-division
courses. Diligent students in \ccode, however---and all prospective
majors---will make a special of reviewing the supplementary material
carefully, since they aim for maximum understanding.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

% Please consider the following structure in your course. Evaluation
% should be clearly linked to Learning Outcomes.
%   - Some form of meaningful evaluation should occur during the first 4
%     weeks of the course; **all students should (and first-year
%     students must) receive an indication of their performance in the
%     first half of the course.**
%   - **Plan your assignments so that each can be returned to students
%     before the next is due.**
%   - Most courses should have a rigorous final exam of 2--3 hours
%     duration. Some upper-year courses may not require a final,
%     depending on pedagogical design and assessment strategy. **Final
%     exams should be appropriately demanding in both breadth and depth
%     to assess accurately the achievement of learning outcomes.**
%   - **No assignments should be due in the last week of classes; final
%     examinations will be scheduled only by the Registrarâ€™s Office.**

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Each week of class will typically begin with a \textbf{reading
   quiz}. These are designed to ensure that you have read the assigned
   material carefully. Quizzes given in class may not be made up in the
   case of absence. Online quizzes are open book, but they are timed,
   and only a single attempt is allowed.
 \item Students are to \textbf{memorize Psalm 8} in the KJV and recite
   it to me privately, in my office, in the fourth or fifth week of
   class (a sign-up sheet will be circulated).
 \item A \textbf{midterm exam} will be given in class as scheduled in
   the course outline (Section~\ref{outline}). It may also involve a
   take-home writing component.
 \item A comprehensive \textbf{final exam} will be held during the exam
   period as schedule by the Registrar (see Section~\ref{exams}). It is
   designed to assess learning outcomes---how well you have obtained the
   objectives outlined in Section~\ref{outcomes}. Test your readiness
   for the final by reviewing those paragraphs.

\section{Course Outline}
\label{outline}

Readings of a given day are to be completed before the start of class
on the same date. Primary readings are compulsory. Any supplementary
readings that I circulate (see Section~\ref{supplementary}) will
be keyed to the session number (listed under \textbf{\S} in
Table~\ref{schedule}), and should ideally be read before class as well.
We will adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, though I reserve
the right to adjust it to suit the needs of the class.
